Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house.  We took off at probably 11 pm, rode up the road about a quarter mile, and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow, with no tracks.  I was leading the way for about a half hour, then we stopped and talked for a little bit.  We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods.  I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me.  I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down.  I figured it was just a moose or something.  But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot.  It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me.  It was running in the opposite direction.  I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind.  It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness.  I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said \"We need to get out of here,\"  and rode back towards my house.  When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods.  But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn\\'t anything human.  For a long time I was made fun of and everyone told me I was crazy so I didn\\'t like talking about it.  Some tracks in the snow, and a clearing in the fresh snow where it looked like a large animal had pushed snow aside and layed down.My two friends were snowmachining behind me but did not see it. If it had been light outside they might have seen it, but it was pitch black outside. My only light was from my snowmachine.I have not heard of any other incidents in Anchorage.Middle of the night. The only light was the headlight from my snowmachine.In the middle of the woods, in a clearing covered in snow, with only small shrubs and bushes sticking out of the snow.

To get to it our way, go down Dowling Road(left off of Lake Otis), where you will walk a trail. Follow it all the way down, but there are multiple entrances and trails.AnchorageDowlingMe and a couple of friends had been bored, when I decided we should take a walk through the woods behind my house. I didn't think much of it, as me and my friend have done it many times before. There were four of us, and we set out at about 11 o'clock at night. It was rather dark, but there was light from the moon. The weather was rather cold, as we did this in the winter. The area we walked on was game trails (trails that moose walk on) as well as trails used for mushers, runners, cross country skiiers, and that sort. We had walked about 2 miles from my house to another entrance where most people enter. On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot, and UFOs. When we reached the bridge where most people come in, one friend had smoked a cigarette. We then saw a light and decided to go on. On the way back, we heard wild dogs barking wildly, and decided to pick up the speed. It eventually became a sprint, whereafter we walked. When we walked, we continued talking about it. It was then I had realized, some thing had been following us, as well as testing us, or even harassing us. It was much earlier, I just didnt think about it. I had thought it was my friend Warren, who is sometimes clumsy. I had thought it was him who had made noises such as slipping, but it was really something throwing stuff at us. I had realized this about half way back. I asked if Warren kept slipping, when he told me it wasn't, and he thought I could have been pulling a prank. We stopped for a minute to listen when I told the others something strange was going on. We stopped, and shone a flashlight around, hearing noises such as steps, and branches moving and breaking. The leader had thought I had been playing a joke when I told him seriously, I wasn't. He decided to walk behind with me, when something threw snowballs, and nearly hit us on many occasions. It was then he realized that this was no joke, and we picked up a light jog, for most of the way. When we were almost out of the woods, we had again heard dogs, and maybe 20 ft away, the branches breaking, and again, something throwing stuff at us. By the time we left, it was about 3-3:30 in the morning. I did not go directly to my house because I didn't know if it was still following us. I know this was not a prank because the snow is more then 5 ft deep in the woods, and someone would have a extremely hard time to play a prank like that. We smelled of colonge and after shave, and one of them smoked.(Warren)4. Me, w-man, warren and sean. We were at my house thinking of what we could do because we were so bored.noStarted at 11, ended at about 3-3:30. Weather was cold, no clouds, and temp. maybe in the high teens.

About 1000 yards away a large clearing was in view. While we were glassing the clearing for caribou to come out of the brush we watched a large grey animal walking on hind legs walk between two large spruce trees on opposite sides of the clearing. We are both long time Alaskans, avid hunters and have logged many, many hunts in North America. I have hunted all of North America\\'s Deer, elk, Black and Grizzly Bear. I have never seen an animal like what we saw that day. we watched it for over a half  hour move from one tree accross the clearing to the other tree. eventually, caribou moved into the area and we lost sight of the animal when it moved off into heavy brush. We had never heard of a Bigfoot in AK. But we did tell the Bush pilot that picked us up from our hunt that we had seen something strange.

Up the Egegik River thirty-five miles, and sixty miles accross Becharoff Lake to the far south/east corner of the lake on the mouth of the Bear Creek spit.Egegik To whom it may concern, I am a commercial fisherman in Alaska and have been doing so since 1970. I am an avid outdoorsman, hunter and someone who just loves to get out there. Every year after fishing, I try to take a trip up river with a friend or two to wind down and enjoy ourselves before we go home. This year while I was on this trip into Alaska\\'s interior our main mission was to take pictures of bears and the surrounding wildlife to promote a new bear viewing and sports fishing buisness. While on our five day trip, we spotted more than fourty bears. I took hundrends of pictures of these bears and their tracks. One of which, was so big, it put chills up my spin and gave me and my companions a very uneasy sense of insecurity. What set this track apart from the others was it\\'s enormous size and human shape. In one of the pictures that I took of this track, I placed my foot next to it on the ground, keep in mind I am wearing a size 13 boot. Whatever made this track was so heavy, heavier than the biggest bear, that it pushed the gravel so far into the earth that it made us truly speculate what we were looking at. Other pictures that we took of bear tracks were nowhere close to the indentation that this track had left. One of the most intriguing things about this track was there were no visible claw marks as with all the other bear tacks.Both of us felt extremely uneasy of our surroundings and had the feeling that we were being watched. For the rest of the day we didn\\'t have much to talk about, and that night felt uncomfortable at camp. We never heard or smelt anything out of the ordinary. To this day I\\'m not too sure what we saw and I\\'m not making any claims other than the words I have put fourth. I would like to include the photos I spoke of, as maybe you or someone on your staff might help me shed some light on this situation. I want nothing but to put my mind at ease. Wether this is a bear track from an extrememly enormous bear or...? Please help if you have any input.Just these foot prints and how obvious it was that this was not a bear track or at least it sure didn\\'t look or feel that it was.One other witness, and he was fishing prior to the incident.

So we decided to camp at the first available site . We found a small spot right off the trail so we made camp and hung our supplies in a tree down the trail , started a fire and were just finishing a small meal when I walked to the trail to smoke.I was standing on the trail a few minutes when I noticed what I thought was a man on a bike coming down the trail. I let my partner know, but when I looked back it was still in the same spot. I started looking more closely to see a face or the bike or something. It was then I realized it wasn't a person.It was a large dark form legs spread apart, this is what led me to think it was a person on a bike. The arms were curled at it's side like someone with hands on handle bars. Too big for a bear and the legs were too far apart. I called my partner but when turned back to look at it again it moved very quickly into the woods on two legs. The next day we looked but found no evidence of anything on the trail.

You should be able to find it on google maps easily.Fairbanks AlaskaAuburn Dr a mile north of Farmers LoopIt was the month of July, 2009 in Fairbanks Alaska.  I was heading south on Auburn Dr toward Farmers Loop which was about 1 mile away.  It is a wooded area frequented by homes and in general would be considered a populated area.  Houses are on an average of about 100 to 200 feet apart with only the general area around and close to the homes cleared out.  Most of the area by far is wooded.  It was the section of the road where it passes by Pearl Creek Elementary school.  The school can be seen through the woods.  Some of the woods in the area are quite thick and in some places can\\x92t be seen into more than about 10 or 15 feet.  But in this area, it had apparently been cleaned out quite a bit and sightlines into the section of the sighting were very open.  The school and vegetable garden could be seen off to the right from the road I was on.  It was about 6pm and I was heading home after a day of working on a deck I was building.  The weather was clear with the sun high in the sky.  As I was driving, I happened to notice a \\x93man\\x94 standing by the right side of the road about 100 yards ahead.  It was more of an unconscious recognition.  There\\x92s nothing unusual about a man standing on the side of the road in this area.  As I got to within about 50 yards, I looked closer.  \\x93That\\x92s no man\\x94 I said to myself (I was alone in the car).  Shortly after that, 1 or 2 seconds, he bolted into the woods towards the school.  He did it like a wild animal would do if spooked.  I didn\\x92t slow down until I got to the place where I saw him go into the woods which is where I stopped.  I could see him running away from the road and when he was into the woods about 30 yards or so, he turned left and was now running parallel to the road in the same direction I was heading.  I got a good look at him, but not his face.  I could have probably seen his face had I not been so mesmerized and had the presence of mind to look at it.  I was busy noticing other things.  His fur or hair looked to be about 3 to 4 inches all over the main part of his body.  It was a reddish rusty color.  I was mildly struck by how red it was, but it definitely had some rustyness to it.  He was about 6 feet tall and looked to weigh about 200 lbs.  He ran with a strange \\x93Hoppy\\x94 kind of run.  It wasn\\x92t a limp.  With one foot he pushed off with was more a normal running move, but the other foot he pushed off with propelled him upward (about a foot or less) and forward.  I watched him until he disappeared into the woods.  There was a road about 100 yards ahead and I took off to get to it so I could turn right and in 20 yards turn right again to the road that lead to the school parking lot.  So the wooded area he was in was sort of a peninsula and he seemingly had to be in there somewhere. The woods I was looking into from that angle were quite thick and I didn\\x92t see him and haven\\x92t seen him since.  A little farther up on the right was the school garden that had people in it (around 7 - 10) which I\\x92m now sorry I didn\\x92t stop to go talk to them about it.  The next day as I was driving in to work on the deck, I naturally slowed down in the area I saw him (stopped actually) and was surveying the area when a couple walking their dogs were approaching.  I flagged them down and told the story of what happened the evening before and they told me that about a week before they were with their dogs and were on the way other side of the school property by the soccer field and 3 kids came running over to them saying \\x93Did you see the sasquatch, did you see the sasquatch.\\x94  They also said that what appeared to be a Dad was with them who didn\\x92t seem to excited about it.My conclusion to whether it was real or not is summed up by saying.  \\x93It was either real or there was a man in a VERY, VERY convincing costume.\\x94I reported it to the fish and game office in Fairbanks a couple days later.  The person who was taking the report was sort of rolling his eyes through the whole thing as he seemed to be writing it down on a piece of scrap paper-.  I even had to ask him to take my phone number just in case.I saw some people the next day who saw some kids the week before who had seen it.No other witnessesI saw some people the next day who saw some kids the week before who had seen it.around 6pmLighting was excellent and weather was totally clearThe forest was made up of mostly birch trees with spruce trees intermingled.

From what i could gather none of them are too familiar with bigfoot information. Any way they say it crossed the road which is about thirty-five feet in width in four to five steps it seemed and disappeared into the brush on the other side which leads to a river called the Chena. Both of the guys have been hunting since childhood and are sure they know a bear when they see one. The thing crossed the road on its hind legs and as we all agreed yeah a bear can raise up on its hindlegs and even take a few clumsy steps, but, cross a thirty-five foot road.....naw! They say they even came back later (they were shook) and looked for tracks. He wasn't too sure but says he found some tracks that didn't look like any tracks he was! ! familiar with. They were pointed inward as a person who is what i call pigeon-toed. They heard or saw nothing else but were a bit shook and headed home. The entire story seemed incredible to me because the incident took place on a military installation. I really don't won't to get the guys involved because they fear ridicule. They had just picked the buddy up from work.On a road called Trainor Gate road, on the more rural section of it which leads to Birch Hill. Birch Hill is where a lot of us military guys go and ski. Beyond Birch Hill is nothing but wilderness, all around Ft. Wainwright is nothing but wilderness. So on one side of the road (which this part is gravel) is Birch Hill and on the other is Chena River which has the main road of the military post on its other side. The area around the incident is very rugged, with a mixture of vegetation, hills, rocks, etc. There are lots of wildlife in the area also, there's nothing odd about seeing moose or even wolf though bear usually stay clear.\",\n",

Although it\\'s quite close to the Fairbanks area and there are many houses and roads in the main part of Goldstream, the side valleys are still as wild as they were a thousand years ago.  I was hunting ruffed grouse in one if these side valleys (I prefer not to say which one).  I was on a south-facing aspen covered hillside, and had hunted all afternoon and evening, intending to spend the night out on the hill and hunt my way back in the morning.  As I was making camp, a black bear almost walked right into me.  I heard him coming from a ways off, and scared him away before he got closer.  later on, it will become apparent why I mention this.  So I was sleeping out in the open, no tent, under a spruce tree.  Sometime in the middle of the night, I was awakened by something prowling around my camp, maybe thirty feet or so away from me, walking in a circle.  I mentioned the bear before. . . this was not a bear I heard in the night.  My father is a hunting guide, and I literally grew up hunting bears.  I KNOW what a bear sounds like when it\\'s walking.  Whatever this thing was, it was walking on two legs, with a bit of a shuffling sound between each step, like it was dragging its feet a bit.  The leaves on the forest floor were dry like potato chips, and it was breaking a lot of branches--I could hear it and follow its movement quite distinctly.I have to say here that I\\'ve spent a LOT of time in the Alaskan bush, and have never before or since been truly afraid of anything I\\'ve encountered, but I don\\'t mind saying that on that particular night I was literally shaking with fear.  It circled my camp for what seemed like hours, but it was probably only five minutes or so.  Finally, remembering something I had once read about the Athabascan Indians\\' beliefs regarding \"woodsmen\", I started talking to it, albeit in a shaky voice, saying I wanted no trouble that night.  The thing stopped dead in its tracks, then a few moments later, I heard it trotting downhill, away from me.  Talking to such a creature may sound kinda cornball, but all I know is that it worked.I\\'ve kicked myself for this many times since, but the next morning, I didn\\'t bother to look for any tracks, hair, etc.  I just packed up and resumed my hunting.  I had no further trouble with the woodsman.As a final couple of notes, I do recall hearing kind of low muttering sound as it was prowling around me.  Also, having since done some reading on Bigfoot sightings, I\\'ve noticed that a lot of people report the animal having a strong foul odor  to it.  However, I did not smell any particular odor, foul or otherwise.I covered pretty much everything in my narrative.Just myself.Most of the native peoples of Alaska seem to have stories about the \"woodsman\", the \"bushman\", the \"hairy man\", etc.  Other than this, I\\'ve never heard of anyone I know having an actual encounter with a woodsman in Alaska.Middle of the night, clear weather, thumbnail moon (not much light), campfire burned out.Upland Aspen/birch forest, above O\\'connor Creek.',\n",

It was summer on a warm clear day. We were above treeline and had been camped there for several days. I was looking across the nearest valley when I spotted movement. It was on the base of a steep mountainside in bare, rocky terrain, with snowfields descending down the small gullies on the hillside. It was moving up the valley about a half mile away. When it crossed the snow, you could plainly see that it was not a bear. It walked upright with long strides and arms swinging and moved fast across the white snow. It was dark in color like a bear. I have seen bears many times since in the same type of terrain and they do not move like this did. It was too big and fast to be a human. Bears can and do walk upright, usually for short instances when they need to see or smell something and need the height. They don't travel in this manner and not in difficult terrain. I pointed it out to the other guys and we watched it until you could no longer see it. When it was out of the snow it was hard to see against the rocks. We wanted to go look at the tracks but everyone was scared to go down there. We had to sleep there that night and nobody would go outside after dark. The next day we got out and never went back. Twenty years later, I still would not go up there even with a group and with guns. The only thing I have seen that looked like this is the descriptions of bigfoot. Just sitting around relaxingI was telling a friend about this and he said he found tracks in the sand in Alaska out by King Salmon. He said they were over two feet long but looked human. He has alot of outdoor experience here and says they were in no way the tracks of a bear. This was also in a remote area where you don't see other people, only in planes. High rugged mountains\",\n",

Heading south you take a left off the highway and this road led to an old camp near a small pond which was about two miles in.Something that I would not believe unless I saw it just stepped up about 30 feet in front of me stared at me kind of grunted and walked into the woods real quietly . I did have a rifle and a handgun on me because I was out hunting but for some reason I DIDN'T FEEL THREATENED. Although I did turn around and headed back to my car often glancing over my shoulder . I did hear some cracking branches on several occasions and I heard a few low to high tones coming from the direction that the really tall at least 6 feet and shaggy dark brown thing went and what made me walk a little faster was that some of those sounds were answered from the other side of the road .other than that no further sighting and or hearing took place the yearI believe I covered that in my earlier statement I WAS JUST WALKING DOWN THIS DIRT ROAD RABBIT HUNTING.The type of terrain was land was smooth and gently rolling type of vegetation was fairly dense pine and some birch forest. As I stated earlier there was an old abandoned camp and a small pond in the area other than that there was nothing else that was outstanding I dont know IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE WOODS UP THERE IN AK near Fairbanks but at times they resemble the stunted trees near a tree line in the mountains an on occasion there are glorious stands of birch an really large pine this incident occurred in the e stunted growth range nothing much over 15 feet an somewhat scraggy looking pine.\",\n",

It looked at him and stopped on the road and appeared surprised. Then it took off into the woods swiftly. He said it was very agile and quick. He was about 275 to 300 yards away. There was no snow on the ground yet. He said they looked at each other for a bit and he loaded his single shot shotgun cause he didn't know if it was friendly or not. He was going to run and tell the authorities but he didn't saying that they wouldn't believe him. He was very serious as he was telling the story. I know the man, he is a strong Christian. That was probably about late October or early November. This place is near Sterling, Alaska. The location is full of spruce forest.

It wasn\\'t winter yet,  just before a corner, my lights hit something sitting on the yellow line in the middle of the road.

It\\'s head was between it\\'s arms, looking toward the ground It had long, human like hair..at first I thought it was an orangutan,  Then I thought to myself, what would an orangutan be doing in the middle of nowhere in Alaska.  I\\'ve lived here almost all my life and there is no animal like this one..I thought to myself the only way that could have been an orangutan is if there\\'s a circus out here.. I knew that was not a possibility in such a remote area. I drove right next to it and I was at it\\'s level.  If I had been going slow, I could have touched it easily. I was freaked out and thought I must be seeing things, maybe I was tired..My friend saw it too, although neither one of us said a word until we reached the gas station in the town of Healy just passed Denali.  She said \"Did you see that..\"  and I said, \"I thought I was seeing things..\" This spooked us so bad we didn\\'t even say anything to each other about it until we were around people.  We have talked about this, and still agree that we saw this thing. We have given up on trying to explain it to anyone else, because no one believes it..We both have decided not to bring it up because no one believes it anyway.  Why I feel this is so unusual, is there is no animal native to Alaska that could resemble this thing in anyway.  We have bears, moose, caribou, porcupine, rabbits ect..but none of these animals have knees or long reddish colored hair. I don\\'t know how to explain it, and I\\'ve given up trying to because nobody believes it, they think your joking.I don\\'t want to be harassed by any nuts, I just wanted to share my genuine incident in case others have seen it.

She said she could hear something walking back and forth by her bedroom window. She also said she looked out the window when she first heard it, and saw \"something\" big and black, really big. She described the \"thing\" to have been about 3-4 feet above the bottom of the window. When I went down to look behind the house this morning, I stood by the window.

When I got down there, I would not look behind the house, but she was hiding in my relative\\'s closet. She said it was walking back and forth right behind the house.

I am 64 years old and have 40+ years in law enforcement, currently serving as chief of police.With hunting season not to open until the day after next, we were in no hurry and enjoyed the evening with a touch of good single malt Irish talking about our past hunts and the one we were about to have.  Loyd and Davis would not arrive until the first day of the hunt, presumably because Dave had become domesticate sometime after the previous year\\x92s hunt and had to attend a retirement party before being allowed to leave Valdez for camp.With the evening expended and the toll the day had taken on us we were in our sleeping bags and doubtlessly turning logs into sawdust by 2300 hours.  The stove was stoked with fresh firewood and all was good.  About 0215 I awoke feeling way too warm, unzipped my bag, slinging the top off, when I heard a resounding crack of wood striking wood, similar to a Louisville Slugger solidly striking a large, sound Birch tree very close to the cabin.  There being no one within many miles of us, my attention was immediately focused on the sound.  A few seconds later, the sound was repeated, which was to be the pattern for several minutes while I attempted to evaluate it to determine its source.  I finally decided to wake Bill saying in just above a whisper, \\x93hey Bill\\x94.  He stirred responding with something that sounded like \\x93what\\x94 and did not move again for twenty minutes; when he woke up and asked what was going on.  In the mean time the commotion stopped when I initially attempted to awaken Bill up and I was sitting on the bunk with my .450 in hand waiting for whatever eventuality might arise.  Nearing 0300 hours I finally returned to a sound slumber awaking well into the following morning.With a spot of coffee in our gullets and having explained to Bill the events of the previous night we explored the area of the old village, inclusive of the nearby grave yard, in an effort to find an explanation.  We found numerous paths traversing the grassy area around the cabins with a multitude of bedding sites.  Never did we find anything that would provide us with an answer to the question of the source of sounds.  Explaining this to another friend after our return, with the experience of spending many years living in numerous villages, he asked me if there was a native graveyard nearby.  It is less than 50 yards from the cabin.

This thing was walking upright like a man, long arms and what looked like a long neck from the side.  It had a fairly long gape in his walk..arms swinging with each stride.  It was all one color...I described it to my wife as the color of a Carhartt rust/brown full cover-alls.  I called her first thing when we got cell coverage in Tok.  She got on the web and saw where this was not the first time a sighting happened in this very same area.  I was so glad that someone else had seen it!  I hate to say it, but he looked similar to the representations on TV and pictures!  By the way, I have always thought this whole thing was a bunch of nonsense.  If nothing else, someone was wearing a suit to make them look like the sasquatch character. 15 minutes later an ambulance went by us heading east also on the Alcan.  Strange considering there is nothing out there much...  Who knows were the enarist hospital is.  It just was strange on top of what I had just seen.just me. Yes.

We continued travel westbound several miles and pulled into a rest stop on the south side of the highway. To fix a better location we were approx. 30-45 minutes west of Alaskan/Canadian Border, westbound and several miles after seeing animal, we stopped at a rest stop on the south side of the highway. Hope this helps. Also, for what it may be worth, several local natives were having lunch there and we shared what we saw with them. I believe one worked for the state road system as he was driving a state vehicle and another mentioned he was a state sponsored hunter for rogue bear. The hunter thought I had seen a grizzly, from the coloration, the height and the lack of a neck (he reasoned that the grizzly's hump, when viewed from behind could be mistakened for a head). State Highway 30 - 45 minutes west of customs station Alaska/Canadian border.Traveling westbound on Alcan Highway to Tok, Alaska. Had not reached Tetlin Junction.My daughter and I were traveling to Tok, Alaska, westbound approx. 30-45 minutes from US Customs at Alaskan/Canadian Boarder. We were towing a 27 ft. trailer and listening to music and enjoying the view. An object caught my eye standing in the treeline south of the eastbound lane. I saw something from the waist up reaching to a higher part of a white bark tree. I did a double take and slammed on the brakes and came to a complete stop. Whatever it was had its back to us and still was reaching up with its right arm. The animal was a beautiful blond/auburn coloration and appeared well groomed as I could see the waist and well developed shoulders that blended into the head. I didn't see a real neck. I made a mental note using the tree as a height measuring device. I reached for the camera and my daughter but when we left our truck the animal was gone. We returned to our truck and continued driving until we pulled into the rest stop mentioned above. I took a tape measure from the tool box and measured a similar looking white bark tree using my mental notes....The animal I saw stood at better than 9 ft with an overhead reach greater than 12 ft.I did not hear any sounds and this was my first road trip in the area.Myself and daughter. We were listening to music, talking and just enjoying the sights and view while driving.The hunter mentioned above seemed to think it might have been a grizzly....I do not know if it were a bear or not. What ever we saw was very large, tall > 9 ft, with a tremendous reach.I'm now very sorry, that I did not take the time to walk the treeline while we were stopped at the side of the roadway. I now wonder what we saw ? Late morning between 11am and noon. Bright sunny day, dry and clear. Rare vehicle traffic on highway as we didn't see our first passing car until the junction at Tetlin.White bark trees [Aspen?] lined the treeline both west and east bound roadways.

As the day wore on toward evening and he didn\\'t come back at the expected time, Ed scanned upriver and across the adjacent land with binoculars.

All of these sites are on the coast or within ready sasquatch walking distance of it and are, consequently, moderated by the ocean. Such cannot be said for inland sightings, such as that near Fort Yukon, south of the Brooks Range, or Dawson Creek (NE British Columbia; detailed in Hunter and Dahinden, 1993). Both of these locations are exposed to the full brunt of the arctic winter. Seasonal migration would appear to be of immediate advantage in these regions as compared to the overall temperate Pacific Northwest, though unlikely to be established in view of the rarity of these events. In any case, large bulk and long hair would be of decided survival value. ',\n",

Aabama between the city of Prattville and the town of Autuagaville within a five or six mile radius of a creek named Rocky Branch Between Prattville and AustuagavilleN/AFrom the top of this hill the river was almost visible about a mile away through the darkness. We got out of the truck and stood and looked down toward the river. I was raised in the outdoors hunting, fishing, trapping and watching wildlife. I like to imitate owls at night just to hear them respond to me. As my friend and I stood on the side of this hill I began to hoot to see if any owls would respond from the river bottom. Instead of being rewarded with owls responding to my calls I heard a scream or moan about three quarters of a mile away like I had never heard before. I asked my friend what in the hell was that? He replied that it was probably what some of the old farmhands referred to over the years as the hairy man, which some of them had told of seeing from time to time for many years. I hooted once again and the same scream replied only closer this time. We stood there a little longer and could hear something big coming up the hill through the woods very quickly. By the time we got into the truck we were treated to another hair curling scream still in the woods but getting close to the hayfield. We cranked the truck and drove as fast as we could thru the bumpy field. When we arrived at the gate my friend asked me to get out and close the gate so that nobody could trespass onto the property. The gate was a quarter to a half a mile away from where we were run out of the field. As I opened the truck door to get out I was treated to yet another scream from the hay field. The gate did not get closed that night.     What this was I do not know. I know that there was no livestock kept in this part of the farm. I do know that if this thing were discovered and somehow befriended that it would be a great asset to the U.S. Olympic team, for neither Jesse Owens or Carl Lewis can run cross country like this thing. This incident happened to me in 1985.The hairy man has been seen in the general area before and after my encounter. A friend of the witness was with him at the time.Since this time I have talked to several people that have had experiences in the same general area as far back as the late 1940s. Some of these people have seen the creature and claim him to smell like a musty, wet dog. They say that he is between six and seven feet tall. I have had encounters with our friend since this one that I have written about. As far as I know nobody has seen the hairy man on the Autauga County side of the river since around 1991.  The property near the area where he was seen most of the time has been sold and divide into 10 and 20 acre home lots. The reason that I found this website is because of an article that I read in Alabama Game and Fish magazine. This article was titled the Dallas Co. Monster and gave reports of people seeing an apelike man while deer hunting, being followed out of the woods and generally having the you know what scared out of them. these events in Dallas Co. have been taking place since around 1993. The area in Dallas Co. where these new sightings are taking place are almost directly across the river from where he was seen in Auauga Co..  Spot lighting at night with the head lights of the truck.I must tell you about the property. Here events similar to the one that I am about to tell you about have been told of for years.   This property was owned at the time by a farming company that had owned this farm for well over 100 years and they owned several thousands of acres near the Alabama River. This property is gently rolling hills with fairly old stands of oak, hickory ,pine, and dense thickets and old hedge rows of briars and pivot in some of the bottoms. I went with a friend of mine that worked on the farm one night to look at the deer which are every where out there. We used the truck headlights to look for deer, opossums ,coons, owls, etc.. We drove to the top of a hill which was a field that was surrounded on all sides by woods. ',\n",

I was 11 years old at the time. We lived in a trailer on hurricane rd. and my grand parents owned the hurricane landing & fish camp ( what is now perkins landing ). We were left without power after the hurricane so all our food was on ice. It was about 11:00 pm and my dad asked me to walk to my grandparents store and get some ice, so I grabbed a flashlight and took off walking, it was less than a quarter of a mile from our house to the store and I was very used to walking the route on a daily bases. So I'm walking down the left side of the road and I can here the dogs barking and really cuttin up, they belonged to an older man who lived in a little white house down the road on the right. He kept them in a pin behind his house so when I get in front of the house I shine my light across the street at and around the house, suddenly I see something very large run from behind the house on two legs. I followed it with my light as it ran toward the woods, and then it stopped and turned and looked at me. It's eyes glowed red in the dark, and all the sudden it runs straight at me, it was so fast, I mean it traveled about 30 or 40 yards in just a flash and then it stopped right at the edge of the road. I was scared frozen, I couldn't scream or run and we just stood there for what seemed like an eternity but in all actuality was probably just a second or two. Then suddenly it let out a load high pitched growling sound and then I screamed and it turned and ran and I ran all the way home. When I got home I was so upset I could hardly breath or talk, my parents finally calmed me down and I told them what happened but they didn't believe me. The next day my dad and my uncle went down there to look for tracks but they didn't find any. My uncle told me I probably saw a bear but even I know a bear can't run on two legs. The creature I saw was extremely large, I would have to say now that it was at least 7 feet tall very broad shoulders, covered from head to toe in dark brown to black hair, his mouth and large, square teeth kind of stuck out from the rest of the face and the eyes were sunk in. As a veteran I can tell you that I've never been so scared in my life.1, walking down the roadHis father told me about an incident 2-3 weeks after the incident in this report. He and another family member were fishing about 10 miles away in the bayou. It was at night and something was walking up and down the bank moving undergrowth and staying out of sight of the spot light. He found it very peculiar that the undergrowth was not only being moved at the base but also at the top. The undergrowth stood 8-10 feet tall and some of it was a bamboo type plant. After deciding to leave the area it followed them all the way out of the bayou to a lake. When they got there something large hit or landed in the water.

But, as I get older, I feel this incident needs to be documented.The incident occurred in the winter of 1980 a few miles east of Clayton, Alabama in Barbour County. I was traveling with my Aunt, Grandmother and four younger cousins to a relative\\x92s house. It was dark and probably around 9pm from the best I can remember. For some reason, my Aunt needed to turn around and proceeded to pull off the roadway by a small clearing. I was in the front seat of the car with my Aunt, who was driving, and my Grandmother. As we turned off the road, the headlights caught a figure in mid-stride. It then immediately froze and did not move anymore. It was about 30 yards from the car \\x96 very close. I could see the entire side view of this creature and its body was slightly turned so that it was looking at us. The most terrifying thing in my memory is this things huge eyes glaring at us. The best way I can describe the creature\\x92s expression is \\x93stunned.\\x94 The face was covered in hair except for around the eyes. The hair was dark and appeared longer and wavy looking on the arms and legs. It was very tall and massive yet lean looking. I would say it was easily over 7 feet tall, if not more. When it \\x93froze\\x94 in the headlights, one arm was slightly extended behind the creature and it held this position. At this point, my Grandmother was crying and begging my Aunt to drive away. Two of my younger cousins were huddled on the floorboard in the backseat crying. I was terrified but could not look away.  My Aunt kept telling my Grandmother \\x93there is no way he can get in this car\\x94 and she kept the car still and we watched this motionless creature for about two to three minutes. It was almost completely motionless. It was as if the creature thought we could not see him if he did not move. I don\\x92t know how it stood so still. The hair on my neck is standing on end as I type this. It scared me terribly. He kept staring at us with his eyes stretched very wide. I\\x92ll never forget that \\x93look\\x94 he gave us.Finally, my Aunt decided to flash the lights on and off real quick. The instant she did this, the creature jumped towards the woods and was gone. He was about 10 yards from the woods but made it there in less than a second. I can\\x92t believe how fast this huge creature could move.This event traumatized me. I have never been able to go in the woods alone or enjoy camping since this event. I tried to deer hunt but could not enjoy it and quit \\x96 I can\\x92t sit alone in a tree-stand without thinking of this creature and becoming tense. I can\\x92t imagine coming upon this thing alone in the wilderness. I know these creatures exist. There is no doubt in my mind. I saw one up close and personal. We never saw the creature again.Nothing to report.There were 7 witnesses in the car driving to see a relative.My grandmother (same person as in this report) says she and my late grandfather saw a strange creature near their home in the early 1950s. This home is located about four miles from the 1980 sighting detailed in this report. She and my grandfather went out on the front porch late one night and saw a creature standing in the edge of the woods near the house. They could only see its chest and arms in the shadows. She said it was tall and hairy. My grandfather yelled at the creature and it ran back into the wood towards a stream and made a great deal of noise thrashing through the trees and brush. She said they did find some strange \\x933 toe\\x94 footprints the next day. But, they never had another encounter with the creature after this incident.Around 9pm at night. It was a dark, clear, crisp winter evening.The area was thick pine woods at the time. It is close to Martin Pond. This was a very rural area in 1980 and is still heavily wooded. There is also a little known lake in the vicinity, called \"Indian Lake\" in the woods not far from this area - less than a mile',\n",

I was walking my husband out for him to leave for work at about 5:30 am. He was facing me on the porch telling me bye and I was facing out toward the woods. I noticed 2 huge furry things sitting by a stump in between our place and the neighbors. It is a good distance. I screamed because I was scared to death and before my husband could turn around they both stood and took off back into the woods. It did not take them not even half a second it seemed. They did not stand completely up before they bolted so I could not guess as to how tall they would have stood. They were light to medium brown and fully covered in hair. It was too quick to make out a face. Very broad shouldered and while sitting the arms did go to the ground. I begged my husband to stay home that day. It scared me so much. Definitely one of those times you wished you had seen a deer or bear or something. To this day I can not bear the thought of my son going out into the woods. I have not seen anything since. Also we had heard of a sighting in a neighboring town of someone seeing a white one. Later on that same year in another county that borders our town as well someone else said they seen one too.

I have heard of 2 other instances from other people but 1 group confirms they had been drinking and driving when it crossed the road in front of them and the other. But in 2013 while closing up our chickens me and my husband did hear something breaking big limbs off of a tree in thick brush in the woods near our place. After I went in and left him out there he said he heard the loudest holler that was of nothing he had heard before. Not from the same place but was within walking distance. They say we have big cats that sound like a woman screaming so maybe one of those in this instance. Would it constantly break limbs though.

Both creatures reacted at the same time and in the same way. The creatures sprung up 180 degrees and into the woods, away from the road.  There is over 4 square miles of uninhabited, thick woods in this direction, with hills 600\\x92 above the valley floor.

I myself have never seen a bigfoot. But, I have two reports that were told to me. These both occurred in Blount county, Alabama. The first sighting was in 1975 about 2 miles from the Chamblee Mill bridge.   A friend of mine had just dropped me off after football practice. He was driving home on the road that crosses the bridge, this area is located in a triangle between Blountsville, Hanceville & Holly Pond. He saw a large black or brown hairy figure stepping out of the woods as he was coming around a curve. He was startled and almost wrecked his car. His story later appeared in the Cullman Times, a paper in Cullman, Alabama. He later told me that he never was more affraid in his life. He looked it right in the eye and it stepped back in the woods. The location he saw it at is about a mile from my childhood home. The second sighting occurred on Skyball mountain some 2-3 miles from this sighting. My brother was driving alone on the road that crosses Skyball mountain. The area has very few homes on the mountain. There are streches of the road that are 2-3 miles before a house is located. The time was late evening around 11 pm or later in August 1991 or 1992. He had just topped a small rise on the road and began to smell a strong odor (he had his window down). He looked to the right of the road and saw a large dark figure walking through the tall weeds that were beside the road. He first thought it was a horse but it stepped out on the road. He described it as 8 feet tall, large, hairy, no neck, coal black eyes and covered in dark  brown or black hair. He said it looked dead at him and he stopped his car. He thought about putting car in reverse but instead just sat there looking at it. He said it must of stood there a minute or longer. It smelled awful, it had long arms and large dark hair covered hands. It just walked off in to the woods on the other side of the road and he drove home.

I put on my brakes to get a better view and that's when I saw what it was. It was about 7 to 8 feet tall. Dark hairy color and was standing on 2 legs. It stood and stared at me a few seconds and then turned and walked back into the woods. It took 2 strides and it was gone. I was freaked out!!!! I knew when I saw it, that it was a sasquatch. I came home and told my husband what I had saw and he could clearly tell that I was shaken up. I have heard of a couple sightings in Floyd county which is only 15-20 miles from the location.It was almost 11 am. And the sun was shining.Pine trees, foot of a mountain range.

       " '5939abc52acdf6607095368a': \"2013FallOctoberAlabamaChilton CountyAbout 15 miles south of ClantonClanton I was bow hunting near my grandfather's house. Early that afternoon around maybe 1:30 I slipped back into a remote section of woods about 1/4 of a mile from the road where I had hung my stand a few days before. After I got there, I didn't see anything other than a couple of squirrels and an opossum. Right as it was starting to get dark I heard something coming through the woods and I thought it was a deer. Once it got to the small clearing that I was in, I saw that is was a bigfoot. It looked like it might have been about 7 foot but it could have been more or less. I think that it was a female because it wasn't extremely broad or blocky looking and it also had visible breasts. It had reddish brown hair. After it passed through the clearing I climbed down from the tree and got out of there as quickly as I could.  nonoI have heard stories of people seeing bigfoots in the area but I don't know any details.It was a clear evening and I had good light.I was in a hardwood forest about 80 yards away from a small creek.0 in the afternoon. He placed his stand high in the tree about 100 yds. from the deer crossing. His stand is roughly 60 yds. from the creek at its closest point. As the sun begins to fade around 4- deer come to the brush and tree line to feed. TB heard something moving through the brush at 4:30, TB notices the lack of deer movement. This is the time of day the deer should be coming out. As it approached, crossing the last few rays of sunlight, TB could see something too dark to be a deer. Stepping into his shooting corridor was a 6-7 foot tall beast with brown hair and red tint. The creature was of slender build, with heavily defined upper leg and calf muscles.  The creature appeared to be female as breasts swung with each stride. The face was covered in hair, small ears and very large eyes; it walked purposely with a relaxed stride swinging the arms. The arms hung down around ¼ the length of the legs. Being high in the tree stand with camouflage and upwind the female didn\\x92t seem to notice TB at all. The being was coming from deep woods with limestone outcroppings. The witness was completely frightened as soon enough time had passed, TB left his stand and an arrow to head out of the woods.  \",\n",

It scared me so I reved up the motor and turned the atv around looking back at the creature as I topped the hill I came to a stop. As I watched the animal it seemed to be very calm as it turned and steped off into the woods as if wasn't a bit courious of me being there. That was the first encounter I had with this creature. One of the other encounters I had was this year.  Me and a friend from my church went to my land and found ourselves being chased off the back porch of my house  by a very large animal about 1:30 in the morning.

All of a Sudden the dogs started going crazy it woke me up so I kinda laid there thinking to myself I wish they would shut up then all of a sudden I heard one of the dogs yell out like it was hurt. Then I heard the sound of something coming up on the front porch so I sat up to look out the front window, it just so happens that we left the porch light on and what I saw was unforgettable and unbelievable. It was squatting down right in front of me I guess it was too big to stand straight up on the porch. I don\\'t know why it was there but we had left the empty beer and soda cans and leftover food scraps in a couple of trash bags to be thrown out the next day. But to make a long story short I was no more than 8 to 10 feet away from it. I looked at for what seemed like an hour but I never saw its face because its back was to me the whole time and I never leave my 45cal but for some reason I did not have it with me. If I had you would have had a corpse to show to the world but this thing has become aggressive in this area of Alabama where my family lives. July 8th it kills my cousins bulldog, in May it chases another family member. June it looks into a family members window in broad open day time so I am trying to get some of the guys together and try and kill it because no one will do anything to research and capture this thing. We know where it lives and how it travels, all we want is for someone to capture and remove it. I live in Texas but my family lives in Alabama, and they are living in fear of this thing so it has to go one way or another Its starting to kill the family pets and chase people Yes lots of themYes that\\'s what I am try to tell you3:30 am 4am,ishDense woods and homes 0 am on July 5, 2015 the witness was sleeping on the couch, right next to the porch. His cousin \"L\" was sleeping in the bedroom down the hall from the porch. The cousin heard it coming as she had seen and heard it before. Cousin \"L\" stated she just laid quietly in her bed, thinking \"I told him about this thing and he just laughed, so who\\x92s laughing now\". She had heard it approach before and was waiting for the brothers reaction. The dog that yelped was a small dog at the back of the mobile home. Evidently it yelped when cousin \"L\" picked the dog up and put it in bed with her. (The dog being killed that was mentioned was a cousin\\'s dog at a different location, not sure what could have killed it.)The witness stated that all the yipping little house dogs suddenly stopped their barking and went quiet. He then heard and felt the front porch groan. He sat up and cracked the blinds to see what was going on. He saw a Sasquatch come up to the porch, duck under the roof, sit down and start rummaging through the trash bags. They had left the porch light on, a 60 watt bulb, so very good visibility. As he watched this creature digging though the bags, it didn\\x92t even get up to reach other bags. The arms were thought to be 4 - 5 ft. long, the fingers were described like Snicker bars with finger nails, and the head was shaped like the back of Darth Vader\\x92s helmet. The hair was about 4 \\x96 5 inches long, the hair was colored dark brown with a hint of red. The entire back was very muscular, the feet were estimated to be at least 16 inches long, and very broad. After doing some measurements it would appear the Sasquatch was about 8 1/2 feet tall and maybe 800 lbs.  It had a very bad smell like cheese gone bad. The Sasquatch never did turn to where the witness could see the face.The witness was too scared to move, he\\x92s not sure how long the creature was there. He is sure it was at least 20 minutes. His cell phone was on a charger across the room. He didn\\x92t want to move and scare it away. When it was done it just took a leap to the ground and strode off though the yard across a 30 foot road in two strides, down a ravine and was gone.   During my visit I was shown what appears to be finger and hand prints on the trailer. The fingers start at the far left side of the trailer, with the fingers closed together, and as the Sasquatch walked toward the porch the fingers began to open until at the bedroom window it became a smudge of a hand print. The fingers and hand print were at least twice the size of mine. The hand print was smudged like it had been looking in the widow and was trying for a better grip. Photos of the prints on the trailer:There is a long history of sightings in the area. It\\x92s a sparsely populated area with just a few homes that are usually close together. There were more stories, but those witnesses couldn\\x92t make it the day I was there. Other stories from the family include a cousin being observed as he stood next to his truck on a rural road; a close encounter by two others cousins, after almost hitting one as it entered the road in front of their vehicle; and another incident involving a young family member being chased as she delivered plates of food to her grandparents who lived nearby. Regarding the wish to kill something, I explained that we have never received a report where a Bigfoot hurt anybody. That they all have their own personalities and more likely there isn\\'t just one in the area. I suggested that they may not take lightly to one of theirs getting shot. The folks living there who had close encounters realized at how much they look like humans, and they really couldn\\'t kill any of them.One of the children attempted to take a photo of a Sasquatch from 200 yards, here is the photo, unfortunately it is blurry and little detail is seen:There is no doubt in my mind this was a real encounter. I know the area and if I were a Sasquatch, that\\'s where I would live. ',\n",

There were 3 sets of 2 knocks each about 100 yards north of the campsite described as \\x93a piece of firewood hitting another.\\x94  It was very loud and the knocks, though themselves rhythmic, were spaced so that the wind died down before they occurred again.   These were not little limbs hitting each other and he was not able to determine if there were any responses because of the wind.   There were no campers north of them and the only other campers on the mountain that were encountered was another Boy Scout troop camping about 4 miles away directly on Lake Chinobee.  My husband is an avid bfro.net browser (and hopeful member of a future BFRO expedition :-) who awoke and immediately felt that this was consistent with other knocking activity.  Due to the inclement conditions and not wanting to scare the younger kids in camp, he did not have a chance to follow up.  Although he didn\\x92t mention the sounds the next morning, another adult did, and with careful, roundabout questioning all other factors for the sounds were excluded (trees falling, wind, limbs hitting each other due to the wind, etc).  I am typing this since he was \\x93not sure\\x94 of the cause of the sounds and was reluctant to report something that may not have been genuine (since he wasn\\x92t able to go look for tracks).Although nothing was observed, he did look for tracks, broken branches, limb formations, caves, etc., within sight of the trail on the hike they took north of the camp earlier in the day.  Coyotes visited the camp during the night, sniffing around, and one of the adults thought he heard deer moving north of the camp after the knocking woke him up. 2 other adults were awakened and took part in the discussion of what could have caused that type of sound.There are other reports of activity in the Talladega/Clay/St. Clair areas and we know of one other not reported in Perry county.  The sighting in 7/07 was about 1 hr drive (shorter as the crow flies) from this incident.  My husband also observed suspicious activity as a youth 12-14 while hiking with his Uncle somewhere in the vicinity of Vincent/Harpersville (Shelby County) in the form of a huge noise about 40 yds from them as they stood in a creek and upon climbing out observed twisted branches about 2\" thick and uprooted bushes (which was taken as the \"huge\" sound they heard).  He was not interested in nor had knowledge of BF at that time.  It affected them so much they immediately left the area.  3:00 a.m., full moon, recent snowfall of about 2\", howing wind, 14 degrees.It is heavily wooded, with numerous lakes and few people, especially in winter.

Muscle Shoals, AlabamaIn 1979 and '80 I was living in my grandparent's old homeplace on our family farm in Alabama.  The farm has about 300 acres of woods covering an area of deep hollows leading down to sloughs off of a river.  In late summer and fall of '79 we had been having trouble with deer poachers and some cattle rustling on our farm, so I was spending a lot of time out at night and on my off days trying to catch them.  Several times at night and a couple of times during the day I had heard strange screams back in the woods towards the river.  The first time I heard them, I thought it might be a peacock or a screech owl, but it really didn't sound like either, and it seemed to be much louder and more prolonged.I really didn't think much of it until one night I was walking back to the house from the back of the farm at about 11:00pm.  It was a clear night with a bright half moon shining and I could see quite well.  I was skirting along the south edge of the woods about 1/2 mile due north of the house when suddenly I got a creeping feeling that I was being watched and/or was in danger.  My skin started crawling and the hair on the back of my neck and hands stood up.  At the same time my dog, a large doberman pinscher, started acting nervous and whining quietly and started looking back over his shoulder to our left towards the woodline.I eased the safety off on my rifle and increased my pace.  Right at that instant, something screamed right in the edge of the woods less than 35 yards behind and to the left of us.  The pitch and volume of the scream was incredible.  I could feel my chest vibrating from the loudness of the scream.  My dog and I both broke and ran to our right out into the pasture about 50 yards and I spun around and stopped with my rifle up to see if it was chasing us, but it wasn't.  I stood there with my rifle up and whatever it was screamed at us five or six more times.  Also I could hear movement in the dry leaves where the sound was coming from, that sounded like a large person pacing back and forth.  I could also see the tops of some saplings and small trees sway and move as it bumped into them or pushed and pulled on them.The screams were longer lasting and a little lower pitched than what I had heard before.  I also know for sure that they weren't bobcat screams.  I became aware of the sound of our cattle running away towards the southwest.  The woods got quiet but I knew it was standing there still watching me.  But I never saw anything.  I backed away for about 100yds and then broke into a jog back to the house, spinning around and stopping with my rifle up about every 50 yards or so to make sure it wasn't following me.A few nights later, I was up late about 1:30am and getting ready for bed.  I came out of the bathroom into my bedroom and my dog was standing there staring towards the front of the house.  He was completely stiff, with the hair standing up on his back and neck and he was growling very low and menacingly.  It was the ONLY time I ever saw him do that and he was deadly serious.  I got a glimpse of a shadow move across the corner of my front bedroom window moving towards the west side of the house.The moon was shining right on the west wall of the house.  My dog turned towards the west and kept growling even more seriously.  Then I saw a large, sort of human shaped shadow move across both windows on the west side of the house.  The dog kept turning and growling and following the shadow.  Whatever it was, had to have been about 10 feet tall to cast a shadow that far up on the windows.  I was petrified with fear.I finally picked up my riot shotgun and chambered a round of buckshot.  My dog, at this time, was staring towards the north window of the spare bedroom and was still stiff and but not growling quite as bad.  I got up enough nerve to look out the bathroom window but saw nothing.  My yard was surrounded by a 3 ft high, hog-wire fence with two strands of barbed wire on top of it and locked steel gates, so whatever it was, stepped over the fence to get into and out of my yard.  The gates made a lot of noise if you tried to climb or open them, so it didn't come or go through the gates.In the next few weeks, while I was walking through the woods near the river, in two different locations, I found several deer that had been killed.  At the time, I thought that poachers had done it, but they were all complete except for having their abdomens cut or torn open and the guts pulled out.  None of the meat was gone from any of them, other than what possums or coons had eaten, and most of them had broken legs.  Only one was a buck and it was a yearling spike.  One of the deer had been killed right where I found it.  There were broken limbs and saplings and hair all around it.  There were tufts of deer hair hung in the bark of two larger trees next to the carcass.  Some of the tufts were over 10 feet off the ground.  Both of the deer's back legs were broken and twisted.  Even then I thought that it looked like something had grabbed that deer by the back legs and beaten it to death against the trees.I didn't tell anyone about any of this.  My dad and other folks had told me that people had been hearing and seeing strange things along that part of the river for decades.  But I had a neighbor that had told about seeing a bigfoot on his property a few years earlier and everybody laughed at him.In early fall of 1980, my wife was bringing in the wash one night about 7:00pm.  I had fed the horses some oats about 30 minutes earlier and I was now in the kitchen and suddenly heard a scream outside.  I ran out and my wife was running in, scared nearly to death. Something was right outside the gate between the storage shed and tack room/stables screaming just like before.  The horses went running out of there wide open.  The fence and gate there is quite high because there is a corral there also.  I could hear it moving around but could only get a glimpse of it occasionally.  It was MUCH taller than the 6 ft fence there and it appeared to be black with maybe a little silver or grey mixed in.  There's a steetlight in our yard on that side of the house, and when it moved though a patch of light, I could see the light glint off of its fur.  It was tall enough that it hit or shoved aside some tree limbs that I have to jump to be able to touch.  It screamed several more times and I could tell that it was becoming more agitated.  Between screams, I could hear it making a very eerie strange noise with an intermittent clicking sound that sounded like it was growling as it chewed or moved its mouth.   I ran back in the house and locked the doors. We moved shortly after that and I spent hardly any time on the farm until we moved back to the area in 1997.  My son, daughter and I and a couple of friends were coon hunting on the back of the farm near the river last year (November 1999) and the dogs were down on the east side of a ridge and we were waiting up on the top of the ridge for them to tree.  We started to hear the same screams as before about 600 yards to the west of us, in one of the areas where I had found dead deer before.  The screams lasted maybe 30 seconds to a minute and then stopped.We had tried to get the dogs to go in that direction earlier, and they wouldn't and we tried again later, but they kept circling back around and going to the truck, and these are championship dogs.  I didn't get to go back in the woods there until April of this year (2000).  I found fresh deer bones in the area where I had found several dead deer 20 years before.After finding your website and reading about the bigfoot killing deer, I now know that it hasn't been poachers killing all of our deer.  I believe that I will probably find more evidence of activity because the deer population is increasing in our area..Numerous times have found sticks and limbs stacked in a sort of teepee shaped formation.  Several times, after driving down a fire break, returned a day or two later and found a tree pushed down across the break and there has been no storm or wind.Two (see description above to see what they were doing beforehand)Yes, there have been reports for decades of sightings and incidents in the area [these are also confidential for the present while follow up reports are being done - BFRO].I have heard screams anytime from late afternoon to around midnight, but once at about 7 am.

Once I saw the creature, I knew it had made the prints I saw a few months earlier.\"1NoAt duskThick woods, nearby river, secludedhis report was first brought to our attention after BFRO Investigator Vince Lauria gave a lecture at a country club in Alabama. A Birmingham attorney volunteered the information that a caretaker on his land had seen a bigfoot several years ago. The attorney claimed that he had never really believed bigfoot existed until his caretaker had stated that he had seen one. The attorney commented that the man has worked for him for several decades and that he was incredibly honest. \\x93He never lied to me before, so I can\\x92t imagine him lying about something like that.\\x94 With the exchange of names and information we were able to contact the witness and hear his story.In August of 2004 the witness was driving north on private land along the Sepulga River. It was dusk, he had been plowing fields. As he turned a bend he saw a 6-7 ft black, hairy creature cross the road from right to left.  The witness said it was less than 20 feet in front of him running quickly. It looked at him, kept eye contact but never slowed down or stopped. The witness had his window down and could hear it running through the thick woods after he lost sight of it. The witness described that it had a manlike face, with very long arms. The hair was black and shaggy, and he could see the hair hanging from its hands. It was not thin, but muscular. Dark skin was visible on the face, it had a wide nose, and a conical head. When it ran, it pumped its arms. It came from the direction of the river, and appeared to be wet.The witness said he had found footprints by the river earlier in the summer and didn\\x92t know what had made them. Once he saw the bigfoot, he then realized that it had been responsible for the prints. He has not seen or heard of one before or since that summer. He told his boss and family only. The witness, his family, Investigator Vince Lauria and I went to the location of the road crossing. It is heavily wooded, bordered by the river and farm land. It is very secluded. There is a power line road that borders the property as well.Vince recalls interviewing a Native American brother and sister that saw a bigfoot on the other side of the river less than a mile away. Both of them reported having a black bigfoot run across the road in July of the same year. In both reports, the creature was running away from the river.',\n",
       " '5939abca2acdf66070953698': '2000WinterFebruaryAlabamaConecuh CountySouthern Conecuh county.  Exact location not published to protect residents.  This is a secondhand report posted by the BFRO investigators involved.  Witness information withheld.The following is the witness’ account as related to Investigator Tim Cullen:At approximately 1:30 a.m. on a night in February 2000, the witness and a friend were planning to visit a girl who lived close to the sighting location. They were riding together on a motorcycle and knew they would not be able to ride up to the girl’s house without alerting her mother to their presence. They decided to hide the bike on the side of a dirt road and walk to the house from there. Very shortly thereafter, they began to hear what the witness described as very heavy walking/stomping noises. The witness described these sounds as similar to: 1. an extremely large person walking or  2. like a horse galloping only on two legs, coming from a swampy area which was northeast of their location. They squatted in the bushes and listened for a couple of minutes, at which time they determined the noise was getting closer to them and increasing in pace. At this time they decided to make a break for the motorcycle and vacate the area. The friend of the witness was in the lead and caused a branch to swing back hitting the witness in the head, knocking him down and “damn near knocking him out.” He got back up and began running after his friend all the while hearing the sounds of stomping and the crashing of underbrush getting closer to them. When he reached the spot where the motorcycle had been stashed, his friend was already pushing it out towards the road. He commented that at this time he could also hear heavy breathing which seemed to coincide with each footfall. Once they had the bike on the road, they both jumped on and his friend managed to kick start it and take off. The witness stated that he looked back just in time to see a very large creature leap from the edge of the woods out into the road. (I later measured this distance and it was a 12’ to 15’ jump, more or less.) He said it hit the road on all fours and then stood fully erect. He did comment that when the creature landed on the road, it let out an audible grunt he could hear even above the noise of the motorcycle. He said the moon was full or near full, and it was already in the western sky causing the creature to “stand in its own shadow.” Since the creature was silhouetted, he was unable to make out any detail such as facial features. However, he was emphatic that what he saw was not a bear as he’s seen bears before and they are much #8220;narrower” than what he saw (He emphasized this by hunching his arms forward and dropping his shoulders to indicate how a bear would stand and then standing fully erect with his arms out from his sides in the stance that he said he observed the creature to be in.). He said this creature was very wide and had “fluffy” hair which covered it entirely. He was unable to see any fingers on the hands although he did state that from what he could tell the hands appeared to be clenched and that the arms were longer than a human’s. He also said that from what he could see the creature appeared to be a dark brown or black color. When asked about the height of the animal, he said it was at least six to seven feet tall. After thinking for a moment he stated that his father is 6’ 4” and that this thing was bigger than his dad, making it closer to seven feet in height.-----------------------------What follows is a slightly less detailed report by Investigator Vince Lauria who videotaped the interview at the sighting location:The sighting took place in February of the year 2000 to the best recollection of the witness, a boy, 15 years old at the time.  The moon was full or nearly so.  He and a friend had just parked a very loud dirt bike at the edge of the woods along the dirt road near a swamp at about 2 a.m.  They planned to walk up on a nearby mobile home to visit a girlfriend.   Their \"caper\" was interrupted when they heard heavy footsteps running through the woods toward them, breaking limbs, etc.  The main witness was slapped in the head by a limb that was released as the other boy pushed the bike back off of a sandy drainage ditch (which fork slightly off these roads) and onto the dirt road.  The witness, almost knocked out by the hit to the head, got up, jumped on the back of the bike and they roared off just as something large and black jumped onto the road, landing on all fours, then stood up and faced them.  The moon was lighting the road, and the creature, from the rear.  Hair was described as long and not shaggy, but \"fluffy,\" dark brown or black.  It stood, obviously broad and manlike and BIG, looking at them as they drove off, its arms at its sides and longer than a man\\'s arms.  Estimated height near 7 feet. Investigator Cullen:When Vince asked the witness if he’d gone back the next day to see if they could locate any tracks, he told Vince “Hell no I haven’t gone back!” He said it was probably two weeks or better before they even went near that particular spot again.Per investigator Tim Cullen:Several of my family members, as well as myself, have heard what we can only describe as a long, deep, “bellowing” type sound that is completely unfamiliar to any of us. I’ve listened to all the .wav files I could find, and the only one that even remotely resembles the sound we’ve heard is the Yowie file. Peculiar. The last time a large group of us heard this sound was at Easter of this year. There were eight of us who heard it that night. The most recent time this was heard was on Thursday, June 13, 2002 at approximately 12:15 a.m. by my wife and her sister. While I can’t speak for everyone else, I can say with confidence that this was not a cow even though there are plenty in this area. That and the fact that most of the sounds we’ve heard come from much further back in the woods where there are no pastures...or cows.Two, only one saw the creature.  The other heard it running through woods, but was driving motorcycle and not looking back when it appeared.Per investigator Tim Cullen:There was another reported sighting made by a relative of my wife (he’s deceased now) which happened back in the 1930s. He witnessed what he described as a “hairy woman” drinking from an artesian well. When she saw him she ran away. He described her as being covered in reddish hair that flowed out behind her as she ran. According to my mother-in-law, he was always rather reluctant to speak about this for fear of being ridiculed.1:30 to 2:00 a.m.  Clear and moonlit night.

The estimated height was 7\\x92 6\\x94.The estimated weight was 450+ pounds.This sighting was at sunset.  The witness hit her brakes and horn when she saw the deer sprint full speed across the road.  She had never seen a deer run that fast.  As the car was stopping, she saw the creature coming to a stop near the roads edge.  The headlights started to light up the creature as it turned to its left and walked back into the pine forest.  She slowly drove forward until she was at the point where the creature entered the forest.  Her window was down and she could smell a very strong, musty odor with the power of skunk.  She could also hear the creature making deep, raspy, loud grunts.  When she looked for the source of the grunts she could see the creature about 50 feet inside the wood line facing her car.  These grunt unnerved the witness and she drove home.  I met with the witness the afternoon after the encounter where the sighting took place.  The pine forest was thick with trees from 3\\x94 to 12\\x94 in diameter.  The ground was covered with a thick layer of pine needles so no tracks could be found.  I did find deep scuff marks near the roads edge where she said the deer sprinted across the road.  We stayed road side for about an hour as it started getting dark.  There was a huge storm front moving in and lightning could be seen flashing on the horizon.  I decided to make two quick whoops to see if there would be any response.  Two seconds later there was a faint response that we both heard.  The response was of the same cadence and tone I had used.  We stayed there in the dark for about 20 minutes then left because the storms were getting closeThe witness went back to the site alone 2 days later.  She started to smell the same odor again after about 10 minutes.  The odor started getting stronger after another 2 minutes so she left and did not go back.',\n",

I have been in the area over a decade and feel I have credibility here and would do nothing to harm that. Yet I still wanted to report it without publicity.PinckardHwy 134It was April of 2011. My son, daughter-in-law, wife and I had been over at my in-laws having dinner. My son and his wife and their infant son had recently moved in with us. We were in the process of adding a new laundry room and garage on the back side of our house. When we came in from next door my son and his family were ahead of my wife and me by a minute or two. I noticed the lights to the new addition were on and figured that one of them had gone out to retrieve their laundry. I opened the back door and said is anyone out there. I didn\\x92t yell so I thought they might not have heard me. I stepped out on the patio and started walking toward the garage that didn\\x92t have a door hung yet. As I did I saw a dark figure at the back of our SUV. It scared me that there was \\x93someone\\x94 in, or had just passed through our garage. Without saying another word I ran back into the house to get my 410 shotgun and let me son know to join me outside. This only took 30 seconds or less. I went back out but this time I was yelling \\x93if there is someone out there you better speak up or I am going to shoot you.\\x94 My son joined me and we ran out into the yard both yelling for the person to identify themselves. We circled our house and saw nothing. It had rained earlier in the afternoon and evening and as we came back to re-enter our house confident that what I had seen ran away we noticed footprints on the concrete patio deck. These footprints at first looked like that of foot gloves people that fit each toe like a glove does the hand. But the thing that was conspicuous was the size. They were enormous. Not only long but wide, huge like that of what an NBA star might leave. (I say that because I have a pair of shoes owned by an NBA star that my nephew gave me who is on an NBA coaching staff.) My point, these were very large feet and very wide strides. It then dawned on me how large the figure I saw in the garage had to be. As stated I own an SUV and at the back part of the garage where I saw the figure the concrete starts to slope down from the garage. This figure I saw was head and shoulders over the top of the SUV and he (it) was already on the slope because he was not inside the garage when I saw him. I joked to my son and later to my family; you know that thing I saw that night was big enough to be a Sasquatch. We all laughed because we had not heard of any other Bigfoot sightings in lower Alabama. Then your show comes to television and I go on your site today and learn that there was indeed a Bigfoot sighting on Ft. Rucker back in the 90\\x92s by a solder. I live just five to six miles from the post.

       " '5939abcc2acdf6607095369e': '1992SpringAprilunknownAlabamaDale CountyI have looked at some satellite images of the area and cannot pinpoint the exact spot just the area within a few hundred yards. Lot of rural homes within a few miles of the areaFt Rucker, ALmilitary roadsI was assigned to Ft Rucker, AL from Oct 1991 until Jan 1997 as a fire fighter. As military firefighters we would often be assigned to small airfields (stagefields) around Ft Rucker. At the time this happened I was assigned to Tabernacle stagefield. Tabernacle was on the north west end of a large impact area used for aerial gunnery by pilots in training. During a typical duty day we would have several down time periods where aircraft were not flying. These down time periods would typically take place around noon and evening lasting 2.5 to 3 hours. When I was assigned to Ft Rucker, I had met some other Soldiers that introduced me to Indian \\x93relic\\x94 hunting. This consisted mostly of lots of walking through tilled fields, creek washouts, and recently cleared timber tracts looking for arrowheads and anything else related to the old Indian tribes that formally lived in the south east Alabama region. I had found that the down times when aircraft were not flying often granted me the chance to get out in the woods to hunt for arrowheads. Often I was able to get several miles away from the stage field during the down times and was usually by myself for several hours.My typical hiking outfit was to put on a pair of cargo shorts, an old pair of army boots, a belt with a canteen, a pouch (for any finds), a large survival knife, ball cap and a walking stick. I usually would not wear a shirt hoping to get a tan while out walking.This day in particular was in I left my stage field around 1100 AM or so. I headed East, North East for about 1.5 miles on an improved asphalt road that bordered the impact area. I then head north down a dirt road (path was more like it) that was seldom traveled. The road went up and down some gentle hills and was bordered on both sides by heavy vegetation and thick woods. I believe I had walked maybe ¾ of a mile when I was approaching a small creek crossing which was not unusual. I was maybe within 50 feet of the creek when off to my left side I heard a lot of movement approximately 150-200 feet into the woods appearing to come from the creek bank. I heard what I can only describe as a grunt and my first though was a wild pig. That thought was quickly erased though, as I immediately got instant chills\\x85goosebumps running my entire body\\x85and had the heavy feeling that I was not alone. I heard another grunt and peered into the woods from where the sound came from and saw a large \\x93shadow\\x94\\x85easily 6 to 7 foot tall stand from the creek bed. Because of the thick woods I got no clear view of it but my first thought was that it was a large very dirty man but it definitely had the appearance of a man shape. I only saw this thing for a few seconds as it appeared to see me\\x85and me watching it and it turned and went crashing into the woods away from me. I wasted no time turning my walk into a trot away from what I had just seen. Whatever it was it scared me and as I headed back to my airfield I tried to make sense of it. The only thing I could conceive it being was that maybe it might have been a stray horse back in the woods. I know this sounds very unlikely but I really didn\\x92t want to believe I might have seen something I could not explain\\x85a horse in the woods I could almost believe. I never went back into that area of the woods again, and seldom ventured into thick woods period after that. I never gave it much thought after that as I had chalked it up as being a horse, which seemed to make sense to me. I did bring my strange experience up a couple of times to some folks but they thought I was kidding them and none of them had ever heard of anything like that in Alabama before.Two things led me to revise my thinking of what I saw that day.The first being this. In 2000\\x85I was and am still living in Kansas and serving in the Army Reserve. We had a new Soldier join my unit. He was a former Ranger Sniper team leader having been assigned to the Ranger battalion at Ft Lewis, WA. He was a good old country boy from Kansas living in a small town. He and I became very good friends and later served in Iraq together. We would often talk about events in our lives at length. During one conversation I related my story about what I saw in the woods assuming he would think I was nuts. But\\x85he believed me. As a matter of fact he said if I saw something I found hard to believe he said that I should just go with what my gut told me. He then informed me about his experiences. He told me about his time up at Ft Lewis and as a sniper he would often be in the woods alone for days at a time in hide sites during training missions. He told me that at night in the deep woods he would often feel as if he was being watched and would hear the sounds of something large moving through the woods. Now this fellow was an experienced woodsman and was used to the sounds and smells of the woods. On occasion he was able to see something quite large in the shape of a man moving around his hide site through his night vision goggle. He said it would never come too close\\x85just kind of checking him out. He said he never felt threatened by it and on the occasion it would make some sounds (grunts or whistles) as if it was agitated and he would talk calmly too it. He said that he wood talk in a slow, low voice telling it \\x93I\\x92m not here to hurt you, just calm down, I don\\x92t mean no trouble for you\\x94. He said that usually after he spoke towards it, it would just move away from him and would leave him alone. He said this happened numerous times as he was often in the same area. He told me he had no doubts at all that \\x93Bigfoot\\x94 was around but he would never do anything to harm it and he felt that if left alone it would not harm anyone.So that got me to thinking, maybe that afternoon in the woods I really did see a Bigfoot.The second reason I feel that I didn\\x92t see what I convinced myself was a horse is that after culling the BFRO website I found that I am not the only one to have seen something in Alabama. So\\x85I am not alone and I am now convinced that what I saw was real\\x85and not something else. I haven\\x92t shared this story with very many people\\x85but maybe this is the time to do it.   no...never been to that area before, never went backnonoTook place around or shortly after noon.

They were standing there in close proximity to each other and as I neared them, all the while slowing down my speed, I could see three distinct and different sized figures.  I've lived in the country all my life.  I grew up playing and hiking the whole countryside and I knew the area around my home real well.  I have always loved watching animals in the woods but I did not know what to make of these creatures.  As I neared them, they appeared to be of various heights, about 2 feet or more, 3 feet and maybe 5 feet or more and all had brown black thick looking shaggy hair all over.  I could not see any facial features but they're arms were long for their bodies. They appeared to hesitate as though they couldn't decide what to do as I approached them in my car.  All of a sudden they ran across the road in front of me and vanished into the thick bushes and trees on the other side of the road. They did not stoop over but ran upright and with swiftness.  I was stunned.  They were no animal I had ever encountered before.  I started to slow down and get out of my car, but all of a sudden it hit me.  I've seen something that can't be explained other than these creatures are not normal creatures.  I was spooked and the hair stood up on the back of my neck.  I quickly gassed the car and sped home and told my encounters with these creatures to my husband and sons.  I will never forget this.  I know what I saw and it will always be with me.  I was driving and alone.2:00 p.m. in July of 1985.  A clear summer afternoonThe creatures crossed the road coming out of a large wooded area and into another wooded area.

It was about 12 midnight and I was on my way home. It was raining, not to hard but steady. I was going down the highway through the country side and on each side of the road up ahead were guard rails with woody swamps on each side. My headlights lit up the reflectors on the guard rails all the way down them. About mid way down the rail I saw a black space, almost like a gap in the rail. Once I got a little closer I realized it was some type of animal. It looked hairy, and as if it were standing over the rail crossing it. But before I got close enough to see, it had went into the woods. But it was big and I honestly didn't really know what it was, so I didn't think much of it until, about a week or so ago. I was leaving my house heading to work, it was about 8:30 or 9 in the morning.There was a very lite rain. I pulled out onto the highway (same one I had the first sighting on) and as soon as I pulled out about 200 to 300 yards I saw something weird looking on the side of the road, something out of place. As I started down the road it slowly walked out on the highway and took its time walking across the road, then stepped over the guard rail (same one as first sighting). It did this with ease. It walked down the ditch and into the woods. At this point it was about 150 yards in front of me. Its pretty open where it walked out so I got an okay look at it, but it was still a couple hundred yards out. Things that caught my attention were the way it seemed to walk. It had short legs and a longer upper body. Its head stuck up away from the shoulders. The arms hung beside it and hands were nearly touching the knees. It was all black. At first sight I was just like, that's a man, but the closer I got the more I realize how different it looked. How much bigger it appeared. Plus it came from the woods, walked across the road into a swampy area. With no cars or anyone around. It just seemed out of place to me. That's what made me focus on more detail. You could tell it didn't have clothes on because it was just one slick figure. Not baggy from jackets/ pants/ etc. Not to mention it was rainy and around 30 degrees that morning. Whatever it was, I had never seen and I hunt all the time in the woods. But I will say it was defiantly not a bear or any human I've ever seen before. This thing was big and it gave you a chill just seeing it. I'm going back tomorrow to see if I can find any hair that may of caught the rail or any tracks, just anything that catches my eye. I want to believe they are really out there and seeing this was amazing. Thanks for your time I went back to the located and found it hard for me to step over the guard rail and to walk through the woods and it seems to do it with ease. None None that I know of The 2nd main sighting I had was around 8:30 in the morning. Around 30 degrees and a lite rain, kind of cloudy.Swampy woods on both sides of the road then turns in to forest.

Abbeville, Alabamastate highway 95When my aunt was about 11 or 12 years old, she was helping her older cousin (Jerry) in the field at her aunt\\'s house in an area called \"Screamer\" in Henry County, Alabama.  It was a hot day, and after some time Jerry grew very thirsty and asked my aunt to walk up the road to the house and get him a glass of water.  My aunt then walked through the field back toward the dirt road leading to her aunt\\'s house.  Upon reaching the dirt road, she saw two creatures standing on the other side of the road.  She stopped and began slowly backing up, then stopped again.  She stood there looking at them, and they looking at her, for a minute or so, long enough for her to get a good look at them.  They were only around 10 feet away from her at that point - she on one side of the dirt road and they on the other.  She described them as standing next to each other.  One was, in her estimation, around 5 feet tall and the other was slightly shorter, around 4 feet tall.  She said that she got the impression that they were young.  She said that they were \"real hairy\" and completely covered in dark brownish black hair, that they looked sort of like gorillas but with human looking faces with hair on them, human looking hands, and human looking feet.  She said their noses were free of hair and that the color of their noses was dark brown or black, as were their feet and hands.  They stood very still other than blinking, just looking at her.  Except for being covered in thick hair, their faces looked human with regular human-looking noses.  After a minute or so, she took off running as fast as she could back up to the house to get the water Jerry had requested.  She did not look back as she ran.  She got the water, and proceeded to walk back toward the field.  The creatures were not there anymore.  She never told anyone about this incident until just a couple of months ago because she was always afraid people would make fun of her.No other witnesses.  just prior to the incident, the witness had been helping her cousin in the cornfield.afternoonAt the time of the sighting, there was only one house along that road, and the road was not paved.  it was a dirt country road.  The side of the road where the bigfoots were seen standing together was extremely dense forestry and trees for miles and miles.  The opposite side of the road was a large cornfield where the witness and her cousin were working \"putting soda on the corn\" (fertilizing the corn) for the witness\\' aunt, who owned the cornfield (her cousin still lives there in the same house where he lived at the time of the sighting). oth creatures were slightly stooped.Both had very long arms.The location of this sighting is still mostly woodlands to this day with very few homes over a 60 square mile area.  There is an abundance of wildlife and water with the Chattahoochee River/Walter F. George Reservoir 5 miles to the east.The witness grew up with this area being called \"Screamer\" so she never questioned it. After she was grown and started to hear about Bigfoots she started to think that maybe Bigfoots were being heard screaming, giving the area the name. A few years ago she asked her older cousin, mentioned in this report, why the area was named Screamer and if he had ever seen or heard anything strange. His reply was that he had, but he wasn\\x92t going to talk about it. Her cousin has since passed away so I could not contact him.',\n",

It was middle of summer and the Mosquitoes were really bad so I decided to wait until after dark to go because they usually calm down after sunset. I had been fishing awhile with no luck when I started noticing something moving in the edge of the water, it was a river otter. I had never seen one before so I just sat and watched it for awhile. It was eating something maybe crawfish or muscles, I\\'m not sure but it was there for quite awhile. While watching it I started noticing large yellow eyes that I assumed was an owl. I would just catch a glimpse of them and when I would turn to look at them they would disappear. This went on for 30-45 minutes. All of a sudden the otter shot away from the bank and I saw something grey move from behind a bush to behind a cedar tree. The distance it covered was about 15 feet and it did it in a second and made no noise. I didn\\'t get a clear look it happened so quick, but whatever it was was big (if it was a side view like I assume from the direction of travel it was thick maybe 2 foot).

His first impression was that it was a young person in a costume on the side of the road, but he ruled this out quickly since the skin and hair fit tightly to the body.  The creature did not turn to look at them, but rather kept searching through the grass.  The face was not seen.  The witness estimated it was the size of an average human male and maybe up to 225 pounds.  After seeing the creature he asked his friend if he had seen it, and his friend acknowledged he had.   They turned the car around to look again, but the creature had left the area.  They did not get out of the car to investigate the area.

I will say that I moved to Alabama 6 years ago, met and married my husband and he familiarized me with \"the ways of the wild\"...ie sounds, smells, woods, etc.  I learned as much about the outdoors as I could and visit them often to this day.  The experience I am about to share occured in January 2007.  My husband belonged to a hunting club and we spent most of our free time enjoying waterfalls and creeks....looking at stars...sitting and talking, absolutely everything slips away when you go into the wild.  We decided not to go to the hunting club this night, but to an old abandoned grave yard.  An elderly couple used to go there years ago and keep it clean from debris and weeds but since they died it is grown over. It seems to be such a peaceful place full of history and romance.  We had been there often and this particular night my husband was, to say the least, enebriated, and we were just sitting in the car talking...the moon was very bright and the stars were all out.  I kept hearing branches breaking, to my left, I was in the driver seat of the car and my husband was in the passenger seat.  I thought it was probably a rabbit or another critter of the night...but I started to get a very creepy feeling...as if I was being watched...I felt this for a time before my husband asked me why I was looking to my left constantly.  I simply said I feel like I am being watched and shrugged it off.  The feeling did get stronger and I continued to look to my left into the surrounding woods to find out exactly what was giving me this eerie feeling.  This went on for quite a while...I also noticed a foul odor but could not pin point it\\'s source..I thought it was my husbands usual bout of, well to put it delicately, indigestion...I eventually saw a very tall figure and told my husband that someone was in the woods and he was standing between two tall pine trees...He thought I was crazy and laughed it off...I never stopped looking and saw this figure sway from side to side...from tree to tree..never approached...never made a sound.  I looked for about 5 or 10 minutes before I was just too scared to stay there anymore, so we left.  A similar experience happened to my husband 5 years ago right after I moved here. It is currently posted on this site.I have been encouraged by Mr. M. Collins to post my experience..throughout this experience my husband never witnessed what I saw. He says he could not see anything out in the dark because of the glare of the dashboard lights (we had the radio on low).  I am not sure what exactly I did see...I just know that I have frequented these woods for years and have never felt like that before...I do not intimidate easily and I was extremely ready to leave that night. I have gone back to the graveyard, but not nearly as often as before the incident. I am always on guard there.

January 5, 2000, three friends and I decided to camp on one of my friend\\'s land.  We had two fourwheelers and a dog with us.  It was a rainy day and the ground of surrounding area was significantly wet.  We decided to camp anyway.  It stopped raining about dusk when my friend and I started to pitch the tent, while the other two went back to there house for some more supplies.  Mind you we were only camping about a mile from the road and one and a half miles from the landowner\\'s home.  About ten minutes after their departure me and my friend started hearing strange grunts, foul smell, and heavy footsteps. It went on for about ten minutes, with sounds getting closer and at random, as though the \"animal\" was trying to scare us or get us to make a move. It stopped when my friends arrived back and we dismissed as deer, spooked by our presence. We told of the incident to our friends and the landowner\\'s son explained that his dad had been experiencing \"strange\" occurences lately.  We went on with our camping and rode four-wheelers for about two hours. When we arrived back at camp, we decided to stay for the rest of the night. About ten minutes after arriving back, the same strange grunts and heavy steps began again. This time they were more aggitated and frequent. The sounds came within at least twenty yards of our camp. The area is heavily wooded so I could not see the animal at this time. The animal was across the creek at the beginning of the sounds and eventually jumped down into the creek, about a seven foot drop, and stayed there making grunts and heavy steps there for about five to ten minutes.  Being very frightened and defensive, I picked up about a ten pound rock and threw it in the vicinity of the animal below in the creek. I could not see the animal due to the foliage. It must have hit the animal because it gave a loud shriek and ran up the creek away from us, then jumping back up on the bank, a seven foot jump, and running back behind our campsite. It then proceeded to make very loud grunts and ran around the back of the campsite about twenty yards away in the woods out or our fire\\'s sight. It then stopped and we could hear it breathing heavily. Talking amongst ourselves and shouting at the animal, it then made the most blood-curdling scream I have ever heard. I would describe it as high-pitched and seemed to echo everywhere around us. I have heard bobcats and screech owls and can tell you this was not one.  We then proceeded to leave hasitly on our ATVs and went and got the father of my friend. He came back with us and stayed awhile with no occurences. He left and we somehow got ourselves to stay for the night. Nothing happened the rest of the night and we went to sleep. I awoke at 3am to the same grunts and heavy footsteps. This time they were very close. They lasted by my watch til 345am. Not awaking my friends in fear of the animal becoming aggressive, I laid there and listened to this animal. Afterwards, I laid there until sunrise and told my friends of the sounds and occurences of the night. They asked me due to my, as they described, pale face and rattled demeanor. We then went and looked for any evidence of the animal. We found locks of hair in the trees, approx. seven foot high, and numerous large footprints, similar to a humans, but with no arch and a very large great toe. We then proceeded to follow the footprints to where, amonst downed trees and foliage, we found where a large animal had been laying. We found hair there also. We continued to trail the animal\\'s leavings when came across the same sounds of footsteps. They were too scared to go over the hill and see the animal making the noise so they told me to. Reluctantly I did, and saw a large upright creature, approx. seven to eight feet tall, walking with its back to me. It was covered in hair, black to dark brown, and had an awful smell. It turned and alarmed by my presence ran away from me. I then turned and ran away from it towards my friends who I shouted to to run. They got up and ran and we ran back to our campsite and stayed there where I told them what I saw.  For a few months after that we heard the same grunts and shrieks down the creek where we camped that night. We frequently rode ATVs down there and an occurence was frequent. Occurences also happened at other places, two to three miles away from the area of occurence. A sighting was also reported at a park about a mile up the road from my house, three miles from the creek. We also found footprints in nearby rock quarry. My brother and I also saw a \"brown\" animal, who we thought to be a man at first, but, trailed him to find that could not have been a man, on hunting land a mile from our house. No occurences have happened in the past three years. But, I also don\\'t ride or camp as much, either.Pungent smell, loud shreiks and grunts, numerous large footprints, and hair.  Occurences were frequent for about two months after the incident.Four witnesses.  Preparing to camp.Yes, in Russell County, south of Lee, I have heard of numerous accounts of \"hairy\" creatures that spooked or chased campers.  Also had heard of incident at a Creek south of Columbus, GA, 30 miles southeast of Opelika. Two hunters were chased and their hunting dog was killed according to the Ledger-Enquirer of Columbus, Georgia. It was a off and on rainy day and night.  First occurences started at dusk, ran through the night, and last incident was about noon of the next day.Creek bed.  Pine and hardwood forest.  Great amount of hunting and foresting land nearby.',\n",
       " '5939abd12acdf660709536af': '2002SpringMay05/30/2002AlabamaLee CountyMoved to private investigatiors section.OpelikaLee county road 156One evening my wife and I decided to go to my hunting club property to a place where we used to go sit and talk. We got there just before dark and had been there for several hours when it happened. The place where we were is on a large power transmission line right of way.There is a small stream that crosses the clearing, and a very steep hill on the side where we parked. In fact, so steep that it is difficult to drive a four wheel drive down to the stream. On the other side of the stream there is a low level spot that then becomes another steep hill. I would say that the hills are a good 50 feet higher than the stream.I had parked my truck on the hilltop, and we sat on the tailgate facing the stream. Around 11:00 pm we heard a very loud snorting noise coming from the bottom of the hill, and the sound of brush moving and breaking. I thought that it was a wild hog, because they are plentiful in this area, so I told my wife to get in the truck, because I was afraid it would attack us. She got in the truck while I tried to find my flashlight and my gun.When she slammed the door, I heard a loud, low growl/grunt and it sounded like something large started running up the hill towards us. I was standing in the bed of my truck by now trying to shine my light down the hill, but the batteries were weak and I couldn\\'t see very far.There was a very bright moon out so I turned off my light, and could see a large shadow moving around about halfway up the hill towards us.I was listening to it move around and make the same growl/grunt noise. I could also hear what sounded like breathing noises.I then caught scent of a strange, musky, sour odor and heard more brush breaking and what sounded like stomping noises. I was certain by now that this was not a wild hog, but couldn\\'t figure out what it might be. So I told my wife to start my truck and rev the engine a few times and when she did, I heard what sounded like something crashing through the brush heading down hill and moving fast. We were both a little spooked by now so we left.As I pulled out onto the dirt road off the power line trail, I turned toward the bridge that crosses the small stream (the road roughly parallels the power line) a large number of deer ran at high speed across the road,heading away from the stream.I tried to convince myself that it was just deer that I heard,but couldn\\'t explain the shadow I saw. Two days later I went to the same location during the day and walked down the hill.In several places there were heavily trampled places in the tall grass and brush,and some brush and saplings pulled up by the roots and broken.(Approx. 1 inch dia.)Two,myself and my wife,but she said she didn\\'t see or hear much after she got in truck.We had been sitting on the tailgate of my truck talking with the radio on softly.About a week later at work I was talking to a long time member of the hunting club(that was my first year as a member)and told him about it.He started laughing and when I asked why he told me that several years earlier,a former member of the club had been hunting from a treestand on the top of the opposite hill,and swore to everyone that a \"Bigfoot\" had walked across the power line along the edge of the stream at the bottom of the hill.I was told that the man never went back into the woods by himself afterwards and left the club at the end of the season.I do not know the man but he was apparently a trustworthy fellow.It was between 11:00 and midnight.It was a clear,cloudless night with a very bright moon.Not a full moon,but it was very bright.It was humid,and the temperature was in the mid 80\\'s.I remember that the next day we had a pretty bad storm. Cleared off power transmission line,lots of pines and a few hardwoods near creek bottom.The bottom itself is damp/slightly swampy.There is a fairly large swamp approx 150-200 yds upstream.A lot of fairly big hills around and the small stream empties not to far downstream into a large creek known as Halawakee Creek.The creek itself empties into Lake Harding within a mile or so.At the time,there were few houses within a couple of miles but some of the property nearby is now being developed.

       " '5939abd22acdf660709536b0': '2006SummerJuly28AlabamaLimestone CountyTanner, AlabamaHuntsville Brownsferry Road -runs in front of my houseI had purchased a fence for my cats and my husband and I had spent most of the day putting it up .We stopped working on it that evening so we could have time to feed the animals-horses,dogs chickens and cats- before dark . By the time we were finished feeding everything it was dark but I had decided to run a cord with a light on it out to the fence and work on it a while longer adding more clips to it . The local high school is about 1 or 1 1/2 miles from our house and they were having a tractor pull that night and I could hear the noise from the tractors .Other than that, it was quiet out . The fence is out close to the barn which has a security light on it . With that light and the light on the cord that I had hanging from one of the tall fence post, the area where I was working was well lit . I had been working for about 2 hours when I heard a noise coming from the woods to my left about 100 or 150 yards away . There is a deer trail that runs through the woods there and the noise I heard sounded like something had caught a deer . I continued putting clips on the fence, not thinking anything else about the noise I had heard and about 25 or 30 minutes later at about 100 yards up from the place I had heard the first noise, I heard something make a loud hollering howling sound . Not wanting to believe what I heard, I told myself that it had to have been the neighbors dog . They have a huge dog that has a hoarse bark . Anyway, I decided it was time for me to go inside . I gathered up my tools and just as I was about to get on the four wheeler, I heard it holler,howl again . This time the sound came from the area where I had heard the first noise, that sounded like the deer had been caught . I didn\\'t take time to turn the four wheeler around . I backed it all the way back to the house, right up to the back door .I jumped off, ran in and locked the door .I was shaking so bad I could barely stand . It was like I was having a nightmare, I couldn\\'t believe what I had heard . I told my husband and we went back out with the gun but we didn\\'t hear anything . I knew what I had heard sounded like the sound the bigfoot made on the programs I had watched on TV and at first I even thought I was crazy for even thinking that that\\'s what it could have been and Iv\\'e tried my best to convince myself there\\'s no way it could have been a bigfoot but it hasn\\'t worked . My husband keeps saying that he believes I had heard something and that there\\'s a good explanation for it because there\\'s no such thing as a bigfoot . He hasn\\'t been able to give me a good one yet . I have called the local game warden and tried to mimic the sound  I had heard asking him if he knew of any animal in this area that would make this sound and he said no . He did say that the only thing he could think of might be some sort of canine - a coyote or if it was more of a high pitched sound it might be a fox . Please believe me this was no coyote, no fox, no small animal could make a sound like the one I heard . It was 100 or 150 yards away and it sounded like it was standing right behind me . I could tell that it was coming from something very large because of the power behind the sound and the sound it\\'s self was like a loud Ahoooooooo .There\\'s no way anyone could have been in the woods faking this . It was real . This experience has affected me big time . My doors are closed and locked  now day and night - I don\\'t think a locked door would stop it, but I lock them anyway . If I\\'m at home alone during the day and I need to go outside for anything, I carry a gun with me . Under no circumstances do I go outside at night now . I\\'m afraid to sleep at night . I\\'m scared to death here now . I don\\'t know for a fact that what I heard was a big foot but I believe with everything inside me that it was . When I found this sight on the internet and listened to the sounds that had been recorded, I swear to you, I started shaking all over again . It sounded exactly like what I had heard-  Exactly-  except what I heard was very close to  me. This is the bad part of it all - When I called the game warden to tell him what I had heard and ask if there was any animal here that could make this sound, he said some sort of canine maybe . I said \"No Sure, it wasn\\'t any kind of dog or coyote or fox or crane - ( which is what my husband said it could have been-but no it was no crane . I\\'ve heard cranes before and they do make a scary sound, but it wasn\\'t a crane.) or any kind of cat , I\\'ve never heard anything make a sound like I had heard in real life before. ) He then ask \" what did it sound like?\" I hesitated for a second or two  before  I said \" A Bigfoot \" He said back to me  \"well, like said it could be some sort of canine or something like that.\" When he said that, I started crying - I couldn\\'t help myself, I cried and told him that this was no joke that I was serious and that I was scared to death now . I believe he was thinking he had real nut case on the phone crying, telling him how scared she was cause she heard a BIGFOOT in the woods behind her house. I think he got a good laugh out of it anyway . Please believe me every word I\\'ve put down on this page is true . There is something in the woods behind my house that hollers, howls and I\\'m very scared of what it could be . I didn\\'t see what it was and I pray to God that I never do, I did hear it and I also pray to God that I won\\'t hear it again . But with God as my witness this is true . One more thing I would like to say that I have wondered about. I mentioned the tractor pull and I\\'ve wondered if maybe the sounds the tractors were making when they would start to pull -the winding up sound of the motors could have been the reason this thing was hollering-maybe it thought there was another one around calling to it but in fact it was the tractors, I don\\'t know. I\\'ve thought about what everyone around where I live would be saying about me if they found out that I said I had heard bigfoot in the woods behind my house. If no evidence could be found to show that what I was saying was true, I would have big looney toon wrote across my back as long as I live here, I would be laughed at by everybody. Iv\\'e decided that I and only I know what I heard and I know how it\\'s affected me -I feel like I\\'ve had a close encounter with evil - something I had heard might exist but I didn\\'t really  ever want find out if they did, especially from personal experience . I know that I and only I will have to deal with this feeling and that I don\\'t really care what people here say as long as I know I\\'m telling the truth . If  somehow someone did this as a hoax, (no way) they did a great job. I\\'d have to say that they\\'re professionals. No way is this a hoax on my part. I\\'ve never been more serious about anything before as I am about this. Because I am so afraid here now, especially at night, I called the game warden back today and asked if could investigate this just to see if there might be evidence that this thing might have been or might still be in the woods here. He said that they hadn\\'t had anyone else report anything  like this but he would check it out. I don\\'t know if he will or not. The answer to my prayers would be for him to investigate it, find it, catch it, and take as far away from my house as he could go. Now that I\\'ve wrote all this down and hopefully been able to convince you that this is not o hoax- I only hope that your sight is no hoax!nothing, and I hope I never hear it againOnly me, I wish there had been a witnessnoBetween 10:30 and 11:30 p.m.woods behind my house',\n",

       " '5939abd32acdf660709536b3': '1978SpringAlabamaLimestone CountyThe main sighting report I leave here happened in Limestone Co. Alabama along a slew of the Tennessee River named Elk Creek, Approx. 12 miles (northwest, I think) from Athens. The other lesser sighting or encounters I list are all from the southeast Alabama area. They are from Coffee, Geneva, Henry and Pike Counties.AthensThe main sighting, as I wish to refer to it here, took place in Limestone county along Elk Creek. It occurred in the spring of 1978 or 79. I cannot seem to recall eactly since it has been many years ago. I\\'m in my early 30\\'s now but, at the time of the sighting I was 13 or 14. I was on an annual family visit to my Grandparents place in Athens. We had gone out to \"the River\" for a few days. I can\\'t recall what day it was but I do remember that is was in the early afternoon. I was a typical kid then so naturally I was doing kid stuff. I had a Frog gig and I was downat the boathouse pier throwing it into the shallow water trying to randomly hit something in the water. ( I did nail a Crappie but, I did not hurt it bad so I let it go). At the end of the slew was a swampy area. This area started approx. 175 to 250 yards from my Grandparents cabin. It was shallow water and several hardwood trees such as Oak or Dogwood, for example, growing within the swamp. The swamp went back perhaps a few miles. (No one in my family nor myself, except maybe my Grandfather, had ventured too far into that swamp). Along the sloping bank from the cabin to the swamp were 3 other cabins with piers. Across from the cabins is a gentle sloping pasture, next to it are a couple of cabins and boathouses. It seems that every time I was at the boathouse and I looked across the water there were always cows in the pasture. However, that day I just let the Crappy go and I happened to look out toward the swamp. As i did I noticed something emerge from the swamp, next to and below the pasture fence about 50 feet, and wade into the water of the slew. It was dark in color, black I think,( this I know because it was a sunny day), it stood upright. It had waded into the water \"knee\" deep. I did not really pay attention at first thinking it was a Bear. However, I looked again a few seconds later and soon realized it was not a bear. It was tall, approx. 8 or 9 feet, well built, and very hairy. I could not make out any facial features due  to the distance, I did not notice a neck and the head was round shaped. The animal proceeded to look both ways, it then bent over at the waist and took its left arm and swung it into the water. I noticed the splash. The animal did this twice. It then stood up and looked straight in my direction. It stood there a few seconds then turned around and walked back into the swamp just like a person would. I stood there and just of shrugged my shoulders and went back to messing around. About 3 or 4 minutes later I looked back toward the swamp again and the creature came back out from the same spot that it had before. It waded \"knee\" deep into the water once again and did the exact same thing over that it had done before, including looking my direction once again. It then turned around and wandered back into the swamp in the same area it had come out of. It did not come back out again, for I stayed at the pier for about another hour and I keep looking that-a-way several times. To this day I am convinced that it was trying to catch fish. I never felt I was in any danger even though it was an odd experience. However, being at that age I did not want to go outside alone after dark for any reason including to use the bathroom. ( The cabin bathroom was in the basement and one had to get to it by going outside). It took me a few years too be comfortable there at night. In regards to that sighting there was something I noticed, there were no cattle to be seen in the pasture at the time of the sighting! The funny side to all this is that I had carried a pair of binoculars down to the pier with me and left them sitting next to me on the upper rail. Not once did it occur to me to pick them up and use them! A side note Two weeks earlier two boys had found large human like footprints in that region somewhere as reported in a local newspaper. About ten years ago my Grandmother sold the place. However, I was in Athens a couple of years ago so I drove out to \"the River\" too see the old place. No one was there so I took the liberty of walking downto the pier and boathouse. Except for a new paint job on the cabin and a refurbished boathouse nothing had changed over the years. The slew and swamp were still the same. I remained for an hour picking up fossils since the water was down, it being late summer. During that brief time I looked toward the swamp periodically remembering, wondering, and well, kind of hoping.As I noted above I did not noticed any cattle in the adjacent pasture to the swamp at the time of the sighting. Large humanlike footprints had been found somewhere in the region a couple of weeks earlier..Goofing around as kids do.Sunny day.The swamp is shallow water. In it are many hardwoods trees such as Oak or Dogwood for example. The rest of the area was either pasture or open areas composed of pine, and hardwood trees along a gentle slope toward the banks of Elk Creek. Naturally, all of this except for the swamp and Creek proper had been altered by people over the years. The only other things noteworthy are the docks, boathouses and Cabins along the slopes of the bank.',\n",

The creature stood 6-7ft tall and was staring directly back at me-it seemed to have fine hairs all over -grey color hair that got more black as the hair got closer to the skin--the tips of the hair were much lighter--the face (lips, eye lids, etc) were more of a very dark brown-it stood very erect, was very muscular, and did not seem to have the apelike protruding mouth and nose but more flat faced human like--after 30 seconds he started rocking back and forth--I then realized this was moving and could in no way be mistaken for a dear or bear or anything else--this was a fully erect apelike animal that seemed to want me see him --he was rocking back and forth from side to side.  After the initial 30 seconds he rocked for about 10-12 seconds then stood and stared at me --I was on the 6th floor about 120 yards away in decent lighting due to hotel lights and street light behind loading area of hotel-he then would stare back then he would remain face forward with feet only about 2 feet apart would lean over to his left with his right arm would start pulling bark off a very large pine tree--it looked as if someone were in a sawing position--then he would stand up stare at me then rock and then pull bark--this was done in that order 3 times over a 5-6 minute period--after five minutes of re-verifying what I was looking at I felt this creature was docile and smooth moving--I decided I would try and get a closer look--as I opened the sliding glass door he stared and I stared back--I ran out of the hotel room and there was security in our hall laying the morning news at the hotel room doors--I asked him to come with me and asked for back up since he had no gun--we ran around the corner outside - as we were running I Finally got the nerves to tell them what I saw--we get to the reference points I had chosen and there were a lot of fresh bark removed from the large pine tree--I tried to pull bark from it to no avail -- it was too hard--I am 6\\'4\" 300 lbs.  I went back after 7am (light) -- I did notice what looked like scat --it took the form of explosive diarrhea and looked like a hundred birds had pooped in a small area--like in a shotgun pattern-heavy in the middle and lighter to the outside perimeter-I put a large handful in a Marriott laundry plastic bag--It looks like feces and digested berries and seeds. (It was dry although it had rained the night before)  One of the Marriott employee\\'s saw two large footprints --more like deep indention\\'s in the pine straw--I took off my shoe and placed my foot in it and there was about a one inch area all the way around my foot in order to fill the indention--Something very heavy had to make these indention\\'s--I tried and I am 300lbs and could not.  I am 100% positive of the above discription--I watched this clearly for 5-6 minutes!I did hear the bark coming off the tree when creature was pulling it off.  There was a small (12-16 inch pine stick with no bark on it) he could have been using it to pull the bark off the tree--the bark on the ground was very fresh and had holes in the back of it as if beetles or grubs were living in the bark.There were 2 other Marriott employees that saw the bark missing and large foot indentions.noIt was 5:40am about 30 minutes before dawn starts to light up fast--Previous day and night was rainy-that morning it was clear and chilly- There was a parking (street) light about 25 yards directly in front of area he was standing.Hotel area-with a natural walking path --small wooded area behind opens to t afield a the bottom of a small mountain--',\n",

It was on Green mountain near Huntsville, Ala. It was unpopulated then. Now there are million dollar homes there.   I was on my way home from my uncle's house on a gravel road. I was on one side of a hill. The road went down this hollow and back up the other side. In the ditch line was Bigfoot, about 8 ft. tall with arms that looked like they reached down past his knees. It was slightly leaned foward looking straight at me.     It scared the daylights out of me. So I went back to my uncle's house and told him. He got his shot gun and we went back. It was still there looking at us. Uncle threw up the gun to shoot and I told him we needed to get closer. So we went down the hill and as we did we lost sight.  When we got back up the other side it was gone. I was too young to remember.My Uncle Ike, deceased.My aunt used to come to our house complaining about noises, and hearing (she said panthers)screaming.afternoon, clear, warm sunshineThe only thing that might interest you is that Green Mountain has a lot of caves on the back side that to my knowledge are still unexplored.\",\n",

North of Newmarket to Old Limestone Rd.New MarketWinchester Rd. I was walking home from fishing, taking a different trail. As I got about 2/3rds. up the hill I had the hair on my neck stand up and a feeling like I was being watched. This was around 5:00pm. I just casually kept walking till I got home always checking my back. It happened again within a week. Maybe a few days. Did not smell anything cause I had been fishing or no smell anyway. Wasn\\'t long afterwards I was checking on the clouds of a thunderstorm when lightning struck close to the trailer. By this I mean I had my head out the door. I heard a yell about 70yds. behind the trailer. It didn\\'t sound like a cow but I checked anyway. No cows had been in the area for at least 6 months. The scream was high pitched without coming down a lot at the end. With my wife being there, I just closed the door and didn\\'t say nothing. I would say the following Sunday afternoon, my wife went to church at 6:00pm. and I stayed home to watch TV. About 45 min. later, I was laying on the couch watching TV, when something had blacked out my window at the far end of my trailer. The window was 1ft. wide and 3ft. tall. I had raised up to look out my picture window above the couch and it turned the corner and walked around the steps at the back door. It was looking off into the woods and as it kept walking, it looked at the ground.Understand this though, I had clear plastic on my window to keep heat in from winter.(Hadn\\'t taken it down yet.) When it got to the window, I had already laid back down on the couch, looking up and lay still. It looked down at me and kept walking, hopefully. I laid there for about as long as I could stand maybe a minute. Then I got off the couch by sliding on the floor, went and got my gun walked back in the living room and waited a minute, then went outside making all noise I could. I checked the back of the trailer, nothing there. Details of Bigfoot is as follows, he was about 7ft. tall maybe 7ft.3\". Solid black, no white or brown that I could see. Remember the plastic. His head was more rounded and not cone shaped. I could not see the color of his eyes or anything like that. He was broad shouldered and thinner around the waist than what you usually see in the pictures and he walked more upright, not humped over like a gorilla. His hands hung around his thighs. The next morning around 10:00am., I got up from bed as I worked 2rd. shift then. My wife told me a friend of mine had come down to see me. I asked what did he want. She said she only saw him as the top of his head went across the kitchen window. We had to set the trailer on 4 blocks high and 3 on the other end, which meant you could not see anyone walking in front of the trailer, not out the kitchen window anyway. I told her my friend was 6\\'4\" and with a hat on you could not see him the way she had told me. We lived on rocky ground but I had one dusty dirt spot at the end of the trailer. Hoping he had walked in it. I checked and in the middle was a footprint. It was about 12 and a half inches long and 3 and half to 4 inches wide at the heel. Being dust it was only 1/4\" deep. There were only 3 toes which I did not  understand at the time. I told some friends at work and one came to see it. The following Friday or Saturday night, he and a friend of his came over, no drinking sorry. And I told them the whole story. My friend was not hard to convince but his friend started talking big. So I told them let\\'s go outside. Joking around to see how brave he was when we heard two dogs about medium to small size started barking and chasing something on the other ridge behind my trailer. Which was not far at all, maybe 200yds. They chased it into the small valley about 50yds. south of us. When one dog quit barking, the other gave one more then it was quiet. Stunned, we looked at each other and Bigfoot started running back towards us. It stopped about 80yds. from us and started to hit a tree with something that sounded like a branch about 4 to 5 inches thick. Then it ran closer to about 40yds. and done the same thing again. By this time all bravery was gone. I went back in the trailer and got my gun. Come back out and asked if anything had happened. The brave guy thought he might had seen something in the shadows south of us, light was on of course. They took the gun away from me and I didn\\'t mind, thinking I had a way of escape. But we heard nothing else. My nearest neighbor is about 250 yds. away.( Mother-in-law) No one else for at least a mile. No reason to mess with us that I could even think of. That was the last I have seen or heard of him.Hung around for a while1 in first,2 in secondHappened day, dusk, and nightHardwood hills and underground streams.Dave Sidoti',\n",

This location is near a power line route.  Sightings and related incidents often occur within a short distance of power line routes. This is true in both eastern and western states. Deer and elk often move and feed under power line routes.  The trees and tall brush are cut away in these swaths, allowing berry bushes and grasses to flourish there. There is almost always a gravelled access road under power lines, but very little vehicle traffic throughout the year.\",\n",

It was approximately 2 A.m. We left Interstate 10 travelling north towards the Dawes community where my mother grew up and most of our family still reside.  We crossed the smaller of two bridges in close proximity to one another when we saw what we first thought must be a VERY large dog sitting in the opposite lane of the road. As we approached we saw the creature was sitting on haunches as a dog would but was face to face with us in the car ( an 80\\'s model pontiac parisienne). It showed no fear and did not so much as budge as we passed it, it did turn it\\'s head and watch us as we drove by. Unlike a dog the creature had a human like face that was the only part of its body not covered in long reddish brown hair. Even seated on its haunches the creature was about the height of an average man. It was more slender in build than the average \"Bigfoot\" we have seen portrayed in reports of sightings in the northern part of the US.  We don\\'t want to say this was a bigfoot but after watching a special on the history channel my mother and I agree that the similarities are enough to contact you and see what you think.We would like to add that local legends about the \"Grand Bay Wolfman\" are numerous and we heard stories about the \" hairy  man monster \" that likes to sit on bridges at night our entire lives, but up until we saw this thing for ourselves we never took them seriously.2, we were traveling back to Mobile from a weekend in LouisianaAll my life... stories about a hairy man beast sitting on bridges in that area were common even when my mother was a child, later it became known locally as the \"Grand Bay Wolfman\"about 2 am cst, dark road but our headlights fell directly on the creatureHeavily wooded rural area with several small creeks and swampy areas at the time only sparse population mostly farmhouses',\n",

At approx. 0100-0200 I was was voluntold to get our bags out of the car since we hadn\\'t brought them in.  The car was about 30 ft from the bottom of the ramp on the back porch and 20 ft from the north end of the car port (which is mostly open, except for a single partially closed in section on the north end).  The night was dead silent with no wind. Upon reaching the bottom of the ramp I began to turn to my right towards the car when I heard what can only be described as similar to a bull snorting mixed with a grunt.  I immediately turned towards the location of the sound, the back of the carport, and drew my sidearm.  Due to a light on in the carport being pointed directly at me, I could not see what it was, but a shape.  I had a small flashlight on me and pointed it at the thing.  It didn\\'t help much due to the light being in my eyes, but I was able to make out a creature bigger than me and at least 3 ft across at the shoulder. It made the sound again, but didn\\'t move. I called out to it, thinking it was a person, but no response.  After what felt like a few minutes, it made the sound again and seemed to get shorter. I began to move to my right towards the car to retrieve a rifle I kept in there and the thing moved to my left, so that we effectively circled each other until it reached the end of the carport on the south end.  I reached the car and without turning, retrieved my rifle.  As i pulled it out, the creature turned towards the woodline at the back of the property and seemed to either slowly run or quickly walk into the brush.  i took this time to go back into the house and get a better flashlight.  I came back out maybe 5 minutes later after finding one, to find nothing.  The guard dog had reappeared and you could hear various insects around.  The next morning I went to the area at the back of the property where the sighting had happened.  From looking at disturbed spots on the ground I could tell that whatever it was, it had padded feet with a step of about 3-4ft., was between 7-9ft. tall, and moved in an upright fashion on two legs. Since then it hasn\\'t been seen again, but there are times when the guard dog mysteriously disappears and there is no sound outside.  the whole incident lasted 10 mts. or so.To add, the dog is called a \"guard dog\" because if anything happens, he will be the first to leave.  i.e, if he\\'s there, nothing else is.  Don\\'t see the dog, you have a problem.I\\'ve never believed in sasquatch, bigfoot, or whatever name is given to them.  But I\\'ve researched this incident for a year now and I can\\'t come up with any other reasonable explanation.No sound during from wind, bugs, etc.  Whatever it was, it was not afraid of me or my guns.  It did not seem to wish me harm, but more curious as to what I was/what I was doing.  The fact it had no fear was the scariest part of the whole encounter.My mother in law and wife exited with me the second time I went out, but none of us saw anything.I\\'ve been told of others who have seen similar things, but haven\\'t spoken to those witnesses.0100-0200 non-overcast/no wind.Field and deep wild growth.

I whistled again to get a response in which I did not. None.Yes about 3 1/2 years ago when I was in the woods camping (cooking hotdogs) I heard this growling noise and then saw a figure that was about 7-8 foot tall looking at me then I said heyy!! and it ran away.

The witness was cooking hot dogs while camping. HM heard a growl coming from behind about 10 yards away. Following the sound he spotted a large figure about 7-8 feet tall watching him. HM thought it was someone playing games, he called out \\x93Hey\\x94, the creature then ran into the tree line. At the time no real visual description was seen just a tall bulky figure. The next day HM went to where he had seen the creature and he found possible footprints, comparing his boot size (13) and adding an additional 6\", made the foot depressions 18\\x94 long. Due to heavy leaf litter no casts were made.The second sighting took place March of 2013 around 9 pm. HM had been outside and heard something heavy crunching leaves. He was surprised to see a large 8-9 foot figure standing under a security light watching him. HM described the creature as very large, around 500 pounds, arms past its knees, dark brown in color, a side view of a chest 1 ½ foot wide, with a slight \"beer belly\" The hair/fur was described as about 3-4 inches long and fluffy like. The head came to a point, sort of oval.  The witness whistled at the creature which turned to look at HM, then moved off to the wood line with a long stride. No vocals were heard and no tracks or other evidence was found.  The creature had been walking behind some trailers that sat close to the edge of the woods, near some trash dumpsters. It was apparently using the trailers for cover. His mother confirmed this event with me, although she didn\\'t see anything.The area has a 3 mile strip that is populated then turns into acres of timber. There is an elk farm just a few miles down the road. Plenty of deer are present, along with many water resources.',\n",

I was kayaking down a creek. It was about the middle of the day. I was comin down the creek. The creek I was coming down is deep in some parts and shallow in some. There are always deer and turkey moving through. When I came around the curve in the creek a splash happened right in front of me. I thought it may have been a fish. So I kept paddling. Then three more splashes hit by me. The last splash I saw it was a rock. So I slowed down in the creek to look. I started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees like a person would. Then it stood up. When it stood up. The hair on back of my neck did. Me and it made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It turned and started running through the woods. I've seen and heard people run through the woods. Its stride was wider than any humans. When it ran it didn't bother dogging sticks and stuff. It just ran through the brush. After that I turned around and started paddling back to my truck. I went back down there that night to see if I could spot light it. I done a howl and waited to see if it would respond. But than I heard two knocks back to back. I knocked on a tree. It knocked back at me. But it was off in the distance. So I couldn't see it.    When I went back the next day. You could see on the brush where it ran through. You could see where the bark on the tree was missing from where it looked as if his nails dug in when it turned around. I've heard knocks before. But never thought anything of it.Middle of the day. Light cloud cover. It was around 94 to 96 degrees out. Mixture of pine an hard wood. Right next to the creek. iew Larger MapThe young man was kayaking down a creek, around noon to 3 pm. The creek runs deep in some parts and shallow in others. Coming around a curve in the creek a splash came right in front of him. At first he believed the carp were jumping. Then three more splashes close by. The last appeared to be a rock. Slowing down he started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees much like a person. Upon standing up the creature and witness made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It appeared to be about 7ft tall and weighed around 400 + pounds. It had a shoulder width of about 3 1/2 ft. wide. The hair was a mix of black and gray along the lines of a raccoon. The hair length was approximately 4-5 inches in length; it was matted with mud up to the knees. It had an odor of fish and mildew. The head was conical, with an almost flat nose. The right hand that was wrapping around the tree as the creature was playing peek-a-boo was black. It appeared to be very stocky with little to no neck. After it was done watching the kayaker it turned and started running west through the woods. The witness stated that he is an avid coon hunter and has heard people walk through the woods. This did not bother to go around brush, it just went through it. After the encounter the young man had enough and paddled back to his truck. He returned that night to see if he could \\x93spotlight\\x94 it. After a while he thought he would try a howl, no response, at first. Then two wood knocks were heard. He knocked back and received a knock back from the distance. But nothing was seen.This all takes place next to a wildlife refuge. While coon hunting on the refuge he has heard several different screams that he did not recognize.  \",\n",

His house is in a small middle class  neighborhood with mountains and woods that stretch for miles behind his home. I woke up to use the bathroom at about 4:00AM and had just laid back down when I began to hear loud vocalizations. The sounds where very similar to the Ohio and Mississippi recordings. I was inside the house and his heating unit was running so they must have been very loud outside. I got up and went out on his back deck but by the time I got there they had stopped. I listened for about 10 minutes and heard nothing. The heating unit was next to the deck and was quite loud so I decided to go back inside. About the time I started  to fall asleep it started again the howls lasted about 3 minutes. Then stopped I thought that it might be my friend snoring in the back bedroom but I don't believe this was so because the neighborhood dogs where barking throughout the area in response to the howls. At this point I knew something outside was making the noise. I wanted to go into the woods for a better listen, but walking into the woods with no one in the know and not prepared for self defense or to photograph or record the creature did not seem like a wise proposition. The howling started and stopped 3 more times and finally finished at dawn. I talked with my son about what I had heard and he and I have also had a encounter with this animal in the past.Neighborhood dogs where very restless during the vocalizations. None friend was asleep. My son had a sighting at Pickwick Lake in the Fall of 2004 I did not look in time to see it. Here in his own words is what he saw. I awoke to go fishing and saw something at about 150 yards away. I yelled for my dad and when I did the creature stopped and looked in my direction. We looked at each other for several seconds. He then continued walking down the hill he was on. I turned around to yell for my dad and when I looked back around he was gone.

We were about 20 to 30 yards from it. we went back to the sight the next morning and we found a small foot print about 8 inches long and a big foot print about 13 inches long in sight of where we seen it. we found some hair on a fence and metal poles that have been step on and bent over the fence was pulled up off the post and bottom fence all the way to the ground. we found a percimon in the area that it was seen and there was no percimon tree no where around. the sightening was about 1:30 pm CST  it was about a 1/2 a mile from my housewe found hair on bob wire fence and fence pulled apart and metal poles had been bent.  we all so found 8 inch track and a 13 inch track and a percimon and there was no percimon tree no where aroundthere was 2 i was drivng husband looking for deera week before my brother and law was scouting and heard a couple of screams like he had never heard before it wasnt human and wasnt like any animal he had heard before an and he knows his animals hes a big hunter1:30 pm very bright and sunny 60 degreespine forrest back  creek small bridge gravel road',\n",

Take a right on Apple Grove road to Water Tower Road, Left onto Darden Drive that winds around to the property on the edge of the bluff,Huntsville, Alabamathere is a road several hundred feet, then a bluff that leads off the side of a mountain.My husband has described a hairy biped that has been seen by him on at least 2 occassions, and by his father on one occasion on Brindley Mountain in Morgan County Alabama. This biped is well known to residents of this side of the mountain. I have always been sceptible, thinking perhaps they are seeing bears or such. My husband is a seasoned outdoorsman however, and he rarely mistakes wildlife. In summer of 99, my husband was clearing land for a family member close to the bluff where sightings were reported off and on. I was sitting on a car watching him in a tree, (hes a tree surgeon). I happened to look off toward the tree line for no reason that I recall, and I saw perhaps several hundred feet off, a tall reddish manlike creature with no apparent neck, standing off in the shadows of the treeline. I looked up at my husband and gestured toward the area. Upon looking back, the creature was gone. My husbands nephew was also sitting next to me, and he saw the same thing I saw. I still to this day wonder what in the world I saw. I know bear, having seen many, and having travelled out west, and this was no bear. Since that incident, my husband was hunting, and he and his father saw from their tree posts the same creature. He would have to tell you the details. He has had I believe one other sighting, but there are many accounts within his family and surrounding neighbors on the bluff. I have heard screams late at night around 2 or 3 am, that no one can match them to any certain animal. They are very similar to sound files we have heard online. Very much like a bobcat/hounddog combo. It is like a howl,scream very loud and drawn out.

Three days later we went back again and this time I saw it. I thought it was a tall pole but it looked to be wavering in the breeze that was blowing. I called Mike over to look but it wasn't there. Then it caught my eye. We saw it walking up the hill where we had heard it earlier. My second sighting was at our family farm, three miles away from the first sighting. I and my friend Bill rode out to the farm that evening to check on things since nobody lived in the house there. As we turned into the driveway the headlights swung, and there it stood, stepping over a 5 strand barb wire fence. It had its hands on the top wire and was swinging its leg over.

It is not a mountain at all, just a big hill. It is supposed to be the highest point in Pike County, at approx. 100 feet high. Go north on Hwy. 231 out of Troy. Turn left (west/northwest) onto Co. Rd. 17. The \"mountain\" is a few miles back. Somewhere down Co. Rd. 17 the pavement ends and it becomes a dirt road (if that dirt section has not since been paved) from what I recall. There are other dirt roads going off Co. Rd. 17. Lookout Mountain is just off one of those dirt roads on the left. I may have actually made a right turn somewhere off Co. Rd. 17 to get to Lookout Mountain. I don\\'t really remember. Besides it was only the second, and last time I had gone out to this place.TroyCo. Rd. 17. Nearest highway, Hwy 231I had noted on my Limestone, Alabama Spring 1978 sighting report that I would eventually submit other sightings that involved myself, others I know or did know or had learned from talking with others. I did not know it would be this long to submit them, but I have since married, had a child, lived in three different locations, had five different jobs among other things since I last submitted that Limestone, Alabama sighting.This sighting/encounter below involved myself, and two freinds, it unexpectdly and without intent being my second. The event I relate here happened to me and two friends in April of 1994 while I was attending Troy State University, Troy. I was undertaking graduate studies at the time. I lived in a campus dorm and had become friends with several people in the dorm and about campus. One of these friends stayed in a room a few doors down. He dated a young woman that stayed in the International House across campus. I had been studying on that paticular night I write of and had become bored with it. My friend knocked on the door and came in. I for the most part had an \"open door policy\". The door may be open, but knock before you enter so I\\'ll know you are there. As Kevin and I talked we agreed to go pick up his girlfriend, Donna and go to \"Lookout Mountain\".  I had been out to the place once before during the day about a month earlier so I offered to drive.  We left campus around 11 pm or so. We headed up Hyw. 231 north. About 8 miles from the Campus we turned west/northwest (left) onto Co. Rd. 17   As we got closer to the so-called Lookout Mountian we noticed fewer and fewer houses. After about 15 minutes of driving we had found it and proceeded to park just off the road. We got out of my vehicle and then walked up to the top of this large hill. The hill is about 100 feet high from what I remember. It is supposedly the highest point in Pike County. The place seemed to be a well known and well used spot with open areas about the path to the top, besides one could see for several miles to the west, south and east from atop this hill. I recall seeing the rotating beacon that night at the Troy Airport several miles to the south. I knew we were not the first people to walk to the top and hang out nor were we going to be the last. Everything seemed cool. After about 15 to 20 minutes we three decided to head downhill toward the car and find something else to get into. I think we had decided we were going to go to Subway for a late night snack. Now here is where it got weird. Just after we started downhill I began getting a funny feeling and the hairs started to rise on the back of my neck, like something was there and we were being watched. Seeing how we were out at night in the country plus having a lady with us, Kevin and I had decided not to be foolish. We had both brought along weapons. I had a Colt .38 stuffed in the back of my pants in its holster and a few extra rounds in my pocket plus a good sharp replica Samurai sword. (Yes, a sword). My friend had a Glock 9mm and an extra magazine of rounds. My friend was in the National Guard at the time. I pulled out the .38 before we got even midway downhill. I had looked over to where Kevin and Donna were to my right. He had already taken out his 9mm so I knew he also sensed something by then as well. It was also about this time that we started hearing rather heavy footsteps. As we moved along I notcied the steps were on both sides of us. By the time we had arrived midway downhill we were aware that there were five maybe six...somebodys or somethings out not far from us. I recall that there were two and I\\'m pretty sure a third distinct grouping of footfalls to my left and two off to my right. Kevin was closest to the ones on my right so I\\'m sure he had heard them much better. Also by this time our Donna had become almost hysterical. I\\'m sure her few screams did not help matters much. Kevin said that it might be some other people messing with us like Frat boys. We stopped breifly. He shouted a few warnings that whomever was there had better leave us alone or speak up, he was ready to open fire. No answers. Nothing. I remained quiet, listening. Now any person in their right mind (perhaps even in a drunken state of mind) would have said something in order to keep from being shot at, I would think, yet there were no answers, no response of any sort. Just slience. We then continued to move downhill toward my vehicle but whatever they were kept back a bit and out of our sight and also to our sides yet they kept moving down along with us, not trying to hide their footfalls. As we approached the bottom of the hill we ran for it,  got into the my car as fast as we could,  cranked it up quickly,  backed up, and took off back the way we had came. I am not sure if whatever they were moved out into the dirt road behind us or not as we drove off. I looked back but, it was really too dark to tell. Aside from that the road was narrow and had trees along each side of it and I was being as careful as I possibly could so as not to run off this road. I don\\'t recommend under such cirmstances trying to drive out of such a place and look back at the same time. It took several minutes after we got back onto Hwy. 231 for Donna to calm down. I was shaken up but not too bad. I suppose the driving had something to do with it. I\\'m not sure how Kevin felt. I assume that his military training had taken over for a time back on that hill. We never saw what they were. Except for the footsteps they were otherwise quiet. At first I was not sure what they may have been however after considering the strange activites I felt they could very well have been bigfoots. I still feel that is what they were though I can never be 100% sure. Even so, what they did while we were on Lookout Mountain would seem much like reported and researched bigfoot behavior.  After a few months and leaving Grad school I eventually lost contact with those two friends. I\\'ve not been back to Lookout Mountain since even though I have traveled up and down that part of 231 near there many times. I\\'m sure with a little driving about those dirt roads off Co. Rd. 17 I can find that hill again. I\\'m just not too sure I\\'d want to find it once again at night.    It was quiet on the hill that night. I did not hear any other creatures but I did not think much of it. I thought our presence had quieted them. I also do not remember if the moon was out that night or not. Considering what went on seeing that I don\\'t remember if it was or not is a minor thing. Two others besides myself. Kevin and his girlfriend at the time Donna. We had been at TSU studying and wanted to take go out for a while.Yes. A woman living along Co. Rd. 17 closer to Hwy. 231 heard unsual noises and heavy walking sounds outside her mobile home one night. I will submit this in another report to BFRO.Approximately 11:45 P.M. Wooded. Pine woods mostly. Lookout Mountian as noted above is a large wooded hill with an open areas and path way going up to it summit at that time.',\n",

Roughly, the sighting occurred at Michael Tigner Dr., about 3-4 miles North of Seale, AL.  Shouldn\\'t be too hard to find, since it was the only \"yield\" or \"slippery when wet\" sign on the right-hand side (heading North)SealeMain Hwy in/out of Seale1981--My first encounter (Sept.):My girlfriend, her father and I were parked on the bank of the Chattahoocheeriver.  My girlfriend\\'s father was sitting on the hood of the car with hisfishing pole in front of him.  He was night cat-fishing.  While we satthere, with the car lights shining across the river, my girlfriend and Iwere sitting in the front seat just making small-talk (honest), when all ofa sudden I heard the most horribly incredible scream coming from my rightside.  To set the scene:  Our car was parked about two feet from the water,on the bank.  Off to my right about 60 feet was where the foliage began. Very swampy, very thick, and very hard to walk through.  About 40 feetfurther up the bank (which can\\'t be seen from our car because of thefoliage) is a huge oak tree.  I\\'d have to guess that the tree had about a 15foot circumference - massive!  About 10 feet up the tree is a huge branchthat went about 20 feet out over the river.  My friends and I would climbthe tree and jump/dive into the river at least once every couple of weeks orso.  During one occasion, there were about 9 of us standing on this branchattempting to make it move - we barely made it do anything, let alone shake!Anyway, back to the car. As I heard the scream, my body instantly went intowhat I think was shock.  As I turned to my right s.l.o.w.l.y.. with all myhair standing straight-up, we heard the next sound~~~>  achuuu..chuuu..chuuu..chuuuuuuu... (my feeble attempt to describe the soundof that huge branch I mentioned earlier that was shaking due to somethingGIGANTIC jumping off it into the water.  The splash that came next wasequally as horrific.  All we did was just sit there in shock...waiting (Idon\\'t know why), staring at this point - straight ahead at the water.  Myguess is that we were waiting for the thing to float into our headlights. We waited and waited and waited and all of a sudden an object - black - long- I would guess at least 9-10 feet, floated into our headlights and stopped.Please keep in mind that this action was deliberate, because it was floatingdownstream.  We stared at it forever it seemed.until it opened it\\'s eyes -two huge balls of red (reflecting off the headlights of our car I imagine)light and looked at us.  My girlfriend\\'s father at this point put the carinto reverse, and we sped off.. extremely terrified.1982--My second encounter (April):My girfriend and I were driving back from our senior prom (Georgia- chattahoochee river border area).  Our high school was 37 miles down-river\"way-out\" in the boon docks.   Anyway, as we were driving back home, we cameto a flat 2-mile section of road that had a \"slippery-when-wet\" sign. Because we were tired, \"sober\", with road-hypnosis, the sign reflectioncaught our attention (she told me after).   As we came closer to the sign,something moved or reflected as we came closer - getting our attention. About 100 feet away, with our car lights fully shining on the it, we sawthis massive, black creature leaning on the sign.  The top of the sign Iguessed to be about 10 feet.  Whatever this creature was, all we could seewas the top of the chest and down (about 10\\' of the creature!) we couldn\\'tsee the head.  It just stood there - we could see the massive muscles - mostin rippling detail, shiny-black fur, standing with intelligence if you canunderstand that term, etc.  We sped-up all the while screaming at each other- scared to death.  A mile down the road, my left-rear tire blew out.  Idrove 7 miles to the first house with a light and called my father to comeout and help us.  While at this home, we talked with a few of the peoplethat were there (they were having a party).  We were told a couple ofstories about a missing hunter, animals found gutted or with their headmissing.  A lot of strange screams in the night, etc.  First, I must saybeyond a shadow of any doubt that this was no hoax - the costume alone wouldhave cost thousands and thousands of dollars to create.  Second, the peoplethat live in the area are extremely poor.  As a matter of fact, the homethat we drove-up to after our tire blew, had light seeping through thecracks in the siding of the house, while it sat on cinder blocks - very poorpeople!  1981: HUGE branch shaking after something jumped off of it.1982: My left-rear tire blew about a mile up the road. 1981: Myself, girlfriend, and her father1982:Myself and my girlfriend 1981: After my tire blew and we drove to the first house with a light (to call my father for help), the people in the house were having a party.

       " '5939abda2acdf660709536c8': '1986FallOctoberunknownAlabamaSt. Clair CountyAround Moody, Alabama.MoodyWhen I was around 11 years old, I had a strange encounter in the field behind my house.  At that time, I believed I saw a crazy old man, but I now realize that is all I could rationalize it to be.  I was walking alone at dusk with my dog.  This was not unusual as I loved to be outside- my parents often had to force me inside by calling me in for the night.  Well, from what I can remember of that particular night, I was picking up rocks in a ditch and looking at them.  I might have been looking for a certain kind of rock but I can\\'t remember exactly what I was doing.  It was definitely getting dark, but I could still see well enough to keep after the rocks for awhile longer.  I remember holding a stick I was using to pry rocks out of the dirt.  It was very quiet and still and there wasn\\'t much wind.  As I was looking at the ground, I heard a noise in front of me and I looked up to see what it was, and that is when I saw him.  He stood right in front of me at a distance of 5 to 10 feet, he was tall, but hunched and quietly staring right at me.  He wasn\\'t much taller than a normal man, but I got the impression he was old because he was hunching.  He looked like Rip Van Winkle to me, and that is what I thought of when I saw him.  He had a long shaggy beard around his facial area, but he was completely naked but for the long shaggy hair that was in matts all over his body.  I remember the hair was thin at his face, the base of his neck, and upper torso, but thicker around his beard, lower torso and legs.  All the hair was grayish white and very long and shaggy.  Mats of hair dangled from him in tatters.  His feet were bare.  His face was very humanlike, but not quite normal as it had very exaggerated wrinkles- again, a reason I thought he was a crazy old man.  His head seemed normal, but there was so much hair it was hard to make out his features except where the hair was thinner.  He appeared gaunt and thin, but in just a moment I would realize he was not like an old man at all.  I screamed as loud as I could out of fear and I noticed my dog bolted towards the house while I was taking in the sight of this strange thing in front of me.  The shaggy old man let out a scream of his own when I screamed.  He was staring right at me screaming in a voice that sounded like a woman shrieking- he seemed very scared of me as well.  I turned to run for my house.  I looked over my shoulder to see if he was following me and I saw him run up the ditch in the other direction.  He was extremely agile and fast- he was definitely not Rip Van Winkle.  He ran in a full sprint, very quickly for someone so hunched.  I think I caught the dog running back to the house, as I was so frightened.  I remember running into the kitchen and telling my Mom there was a crazy old Rip Van Winkle in the field.  I remember describing how he was old looking, hunched, naked, and his hair was very long and matted like he hadn\\'t cut it in 20 years.  I told her about how he had hair all over his body.  Needless to say, I wasn\\'t believed.  I became obsessed with what I called \"the Shaggy old man\" or \"the Crazy old man\".  I believed that he must have been an old deformed hermit.  I kept a notebook in which I drew many sketches of him.  I remember keeping the notebook secret from my family, hiding it out of fear of being ridiculed.  I wish I had those sketches now but sadly I\\'ve misplaced that notebook.  I remember I went back to the spot in the field looking for him on other occasions, but I never ran into him again.  I wasn\\'t aware enough to look for prints or anything like that, but I knew that he was out there somewhere and I wanted to prove he really existed to others.  What changed my opinion of this sighting was a late night visit to a bigfoot website.  I was just browsing their sightings index and I came across several sightings in the same county I lived in and all described white or grayish colored creatures.  Honestly, I didn\\'t realize bigfoot were sighted in this part of the country at that time, or even for most of my life, and just seeing all those other sightings was a revelation.  I realized for the first time that what I witnessed may not have been a crazy old shaggy man, but rather a bigfoot.  When I think back on the sighting, it all makes sense in that light.  There would be no reason for a naked old man to wander that field, much less to be covered in grayish, white, shaggy tattered hair.  The only reason I never thought of it as a bigfoot before was that I had never heard of an Alabama bigfoot, so the thought never entered my mind.  Also, I had never heard of a whitish gray colored bigfoot, and this creature was thinner than a typical bigfoot description- maybe he was older or maybe even younger.  He looked a bit hungry to me, as he was not some hulking powerful creature, but he was still strong looking and extremely agile. I looked for anything unusual the next day, but I did not find anything to substantiate my sighting.  I did not smell any odors or anything other people relate about their sightings either. There was no other witness, other than my dog.  I\\'ve read other reports on www.gcbro.com - similar accounts near this location, but other than that, no, I have not heard any stories by the locals when I lived there.   Right around dusk, just after sunset.  The weather was clear and dry, as I was in a ditch that would usually have water in it if it wasn\\'t really dry.  The ditch was lower in elevation than the rest of the field, so it was hidden from view of the road and houses nearby.  The field was about 100-150 yards across, and a small two lane road ran one side of it.  On two other sides, were homes.  There was one remaining side that was forest.  That forest was quite large at that time, and even now is still quite undeveloped.  It was mostly pines near the field, but became mostly oaks on the mountain nearby.  The ditch I was in when I spotted him ran across the field and sometimes had water in it, but it had dried up due to a dry spell.  ',\n",

I got my flashlight and opened my door to look out. As I was scanning the woods, my light caught two sets of eye shine. One was approx. seven to eight feet off the ground standing beside a tree. The other was around six feet off the ground standing on the other side of the tree. They were around 15 to 20 feet inside the wood line.

Year before last, we where sitting outside our tent around the camp fire and it was about 11:00 at night. We where the ONLY ones in that camp site, so it was very quiet. We started to hear stange low noises almost like an old chainsaw trying to crank. Following that was a very high pitch humming noise. The sound was getting closer and closer. We took out our spot light and scanned the woods. What we saw was very disturbing....it appeared to be an up right figure, that was hairy and had a grey tent to its fure. It was standing behind a tree and was slightly hunching over, like it was hiding from us. We could see its back bowing out of the right side of the tree and its head coming out of the left. Theirs no doubt in my mind that it was an ape-like creature. It stood still for about 30 to 60 seconds. Then we decided to take the light off of it, to maybe see if it would move....about 10 seconds later we turned the light back on and it was gone! The next night we heard two seperate creatures but neither showed up.the year before this icident we heard the noises but did not see the creature....WE DO HAVE PICTURES OF FOOTPRINTSThere where five other witnesses, and we where simply campingnight time, clear skys, no windmountain like terrain, very lush vegitation, creek bottoms',\n",

I stopped on the trail when I smelled a foul smell. We did not see or hear anything at this time. We walked down to the falls the water was very low so we walked out onto the large rocks to sit, we sat talking for about 30 min. I heard a sound like trees moving then I heard nothing else so we were on our way out when we saw a very large footprint in the sandy creek bank. It was approx. 18 inches long and about 7 inches wide it had very pronounced toe prints.Sounds of trees or brush moving.3 people present talking and walking toward the trail.None1:00 or 2:00 AM.

       " '5939abdc2acdf660709536cd': \"1967SummerunknownAlabamaTallapoosa CountyWe were right behind a large reservoir that held water for Russell MillsAlexander City, AlabamaElkahatchee RoadNot a good writer, but what happened to me and a friend  - we were walking down an old pulpwood road with his german shepherd  and got a strong smell like a goat and stopped my friend. I walked ahead about 20 ft and said it might be a big rattle snake, about that time I heard leaves rustling and it got louder and a tree about 6 inches around shook back and forth about 2 feet each way and I heard the leaves moving like something was running away. I pulled some branches back and there it was, about 20 feet running away on 2 legs at a very fast pace. It was about 8 feet tall and I could see its muscles in its legs moving and the whitish skin under the 3 inch black hair. Long arms no neck as plain as day. My friend never saw it and didn't believe me. But it changed my life. Would like for someone to call me. Two weeks later in the dentist was an outdoors magazine with the Patterson film in it.just me that saw itnoabout 1 in the afternoonpines, bushes, near road and swampy down in holler he goat smell was very powerful.The creature was running downhill.The arms stayed down with the hands just below the knees and did not swing as it ran about 100 yards in about 10 secondsThe shoulders were about 4\\x92 wide and the hips were about 3\\x92 wide.The head looked small in proportion to the body compared to a human and was slightly pointed at the very top from the rear view.It was lean and had a very muscular, athletic build.  It was not as bulky as the subject in the Patterson-Gimlin film.The calf muscles, with white skin, were huge and could be seen when the 3-4\\x94 long black hair would flop up as it ran.The hair appeared to be clean.The witness could hear it running, but it was not very loud.The sighting was in an area with pines and a few large hardwoods.The creature ran to an area with pines and underbrush, which is where the witness lost sight.  The area beyond the pines was swampy. The witness never returned to those woods and lost interest in camping after the encounter.The sighting area is now developed, but there are still thick, unpopulated woods to the south.His friend\\x92s dog was well trained and never left his owner\\x92s side.\",\n",
       " '5939abdc2acdf660709536ce': \"2014SpringApril16AlabamaTuscaloosa CountyTake 171 from Northport, and Bone Camp is a right turn about 3 miles up.NorthportHighway 171Was driving home at night about 9:00 pm. Turned on Bone Camp road from highway 171 and saw a large figure standing in the brush. As I turned on my brights it had taken off in the brush. This is the second time I've seen this thing and a friend of mine who lives on Bone Camp has also seen it as well as finding strange tree formations and randomly snapped limbs.Twisted limbs and tree branch formations near the spot I saw it standing. Took photos of branches and formations.Not at that moment. Saw it 4 years earlier crossing Bone Camp with my mother.Friend of mine was pulling up to his house at night and saw a large figure walking away from their house and into the woods.9:00 at night extremely dark Thick pine woodshe first sighting was in 2011 at noon with the mom and son both witnessing the creature from their car.  This route is driven by both witnesses daily. The hair was dark brown, long, shaggy and matted. The legs and hips were extremely thick and full of muscles. The height was estimated at seven feet and weight at 350 pounds with no fat noted. It crossed the road and into the woods in about three seconds.  It moved very fast, running left to right on two legs. It used its hands and arms to shield its face as it sprinted into the thick undergrowth and branches. They were driving at 30 MPH when she hit the brakes.  The biped was about 15 feet from the bumper by the time she stopped.The second sighting was in April of 2014 at 9 pm and happened within a few feet of the first sighting. The son was alone and driving home during the second sighting. The creature was dark in color and about the same size as the one seen in 2011 with a thick back noted. The creature dropped down low and ran away into the woods on the left side of the road when the high beams hit it.The two witnesses went to the location of the two sightings the following day, found and photographed some possible formations made from small, twisted branches and broken branches on the ground. We have reviewed the photos, not enough detail is seen to determine whether or not they were made with hands or if the branches broke and the sticks fell that way naturally.In August of 2014 at 2 am, the son's friend drove up to his house and a biped could be seen walking inside a wood line behind the house.  It stepped behind a tree when the high beams were turned on.  Eye-shine was then seen peeking out to the left then right side of the tree, back and forth for about 20 minutes before the eye-shine disappeared.  The eyes were determined to be about 8 feet off the ground after inspecting the area with his friend the next day.  This happened about half a mile from the other two sightings.\"}"
